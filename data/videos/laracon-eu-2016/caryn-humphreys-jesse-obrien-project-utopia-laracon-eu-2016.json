    "description": "From in-house product teams to remote freelance; from greenfield to legacy, many of us find ourselves on projects that require us to work with team members across disciplines and clients in different domains. How do we work effectively on these teams? This talk, tag-teamed by a Developer and a Product Designer, will showcase some methods that can improve the way you work collaboratively with your team. When working on a cross-disciplinary team, it's important to know how and when to pair up, delegate tasks, and organize phases of the project from discovery to deployment. We'll show you how to get answers for the questions you have. We'll give you the language you need to understand all those pesky design terms, and you'll be given examples of effective dev/design pairing, facilitating effective client meetings, and managing sprints.",
