    "description": "Software developer, speaker and active open source contributor. Being the Tech Lead at Vinelab, he had the opportunity to work on many large-scale projects in the MENA region (including Star Academy, Arabs Got Talent and A-list artists projects in the region) which were the origin of numerous experiments in software architecture and programming patterns for high traffic and heavy consumption, backed by years of experience in infrastructure implementation. Curious about collaboration, team workflows, software and infrastructure architectures and documentation.",
