    "description": "Could you imagine using the internet without eyesight? What's easy to point at and click for you can be a pain to navigate for blind computer users. \n\nAccessibility is all about allowing people with disabilities to use technologies just like everyone else. The web and, more specifically, HTML have lots of built-in features to make this possible, but they need to be understood and used well to have an effect. \n\nIn this session, we'll understand why accessibility is so important, and then take a look at what we can do to improve the situation. \n\nYou will learn neat tricks to get ahead with quick accessibility wins, powerful techniques that will help you make dynamic interfaces accessible, and the three things that you should avoid at all costs.",
