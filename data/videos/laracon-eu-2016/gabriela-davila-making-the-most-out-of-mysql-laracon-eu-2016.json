    "description": "The new JSON fields are some of the most talking about new features in MySQL 5.7. But they are by no means the only awesome things this version has to offer. MySQL 5.7 is about a year old, so this talk won't be an introduction to this version. We will be digging into 5.7 to see how to make the most of the tools available in it.\n\nWant to tackle important practical problem solving for your data, make your query performance analysis more efficient or look at how virtual columns can help you index data? This talk is for you!",
