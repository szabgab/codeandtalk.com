    "description": "You will learn what CMS tools are currently available, how to choose the correct tool, and when to choose no such tool at all. We will analyze commercial (happy business owners?) and technical aspects (happy engineers?) of choosing the right CMS platform, and how will such decision influence website/webstaff performance (happy clients?) in the long run. Finally, weâ€™ll tackle the ongoing subject in Laravel community of not having the go-to Laravel based CMS.",
