  "description": "Did you know your IoC container can do a whole lot more than just constructor injection? Besides that it is actually packed with features. Inflectors, resolving callbacks, aliasing, method invocation to name a few. In this talk you will learn how to leverage the power of a great container and service providers to write better, loosely coupled code. Well designed code put together by your IoC container will make your applications SOLID, modular, lean and decoupled from the framework!",
