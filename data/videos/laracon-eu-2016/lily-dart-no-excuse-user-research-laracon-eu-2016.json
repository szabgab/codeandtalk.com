  "description": "As designers and developers, we don\u2019t always have access to research to about our end users, or the opportunity to learn about them. We hear excuses; \u201cwe don\u2019t have the time or money to do research\" or \u201cwe already know what our users want\u201d. This often leaves us building products based on our managers personal opinion, or client specifications, and never really knowing if what we\u2019ve built is a good experience for our users. \n\nBut the happy news is - there are many opportunities for simple user research that most designers and developers aren\u2019t even aware of. I will prove there is no good excuse not to understand our users better by explaining 3 methods of user research ideal for existing sites, products and services. They are cheap to implement, quick to analyse, and can be used straight away on almost any project.",
