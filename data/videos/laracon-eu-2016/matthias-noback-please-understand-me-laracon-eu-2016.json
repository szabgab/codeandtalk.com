    "description": "In our world there are two kinds of people: developers and managers. The people who don\u2019t earn nearly enough money, given the incredible amount of mind-bending work they do all day, and the people who get way too much money for talking all day (and sending emails of course). Nevertheless, developers and managers - slightly irritated by each other\u2019s presence and radically opposing life goals - need to work together productively, in order to satisfy someone known as \u201cthe customer\u201d.\n\nHaving been a \u201cdeveloper\u201d for years, now I\u2019ve become a \u201cmanager\u201d myself. Instead of hating it, I\u2019m slowly embracing it. I\u2019m in a unique position to oversee and (partly) understand what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll share with you everything I know that will be of vital importance to improve your relationship with any manager nearby. Trying to understand each other (including the omnipotent \u201ccustomer\u201d) will be key to your personal process of becoming the dev that\u2019s worth their own weight in gold.",
