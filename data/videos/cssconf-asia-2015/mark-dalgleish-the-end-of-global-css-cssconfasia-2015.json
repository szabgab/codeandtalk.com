    "description": "The global nature of CSS selectors is often at odds with the locally-scoped nature of component-based web applications. CSS Modules are a new, community-driven attempt to allow us to import CSS into our JavaScript files, bypassing the global scope and enabling powerful new patterns for writing CSS in the component age.\n\nMark is the co-creator of CSS Modules, lead organiser of MelbJS, and interaction craftsman at SEEKâ€”the most popular job site in Australia. Having got his start with HTML and UI design at a young age, he has since developed a love of open source and software engineering, but always as a means to creating elegant, usable experiences.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 18 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.cssconf.asia\nSlides: http://markdalgleish.github.io/presentation-the-end-of-global-css/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
