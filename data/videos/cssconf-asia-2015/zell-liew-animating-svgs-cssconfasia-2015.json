    "description": "SVGs can be used to achieve amazing effects that improve users' experience on your website. They can do sweet things like icon morphing that was introduced in material design, create bouncy buttons that let the user know they're clicked, and many other effects that you can image. In this talk, we're going to dive deep into SVGs to learn how to use them, and how to create these cool effects for your own website.\n\nZell is a freelance web developer based in Singapore. He loves working on the web so much that he spends all his free time diving deep into tools and frameworks to find out the best ways to work with them. He then shares everything he learned on his blog. He also authored Learning Susy and Automating Your Workflow with Gulp.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 18 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.cssconf.asia\nSlides: https://github.com/zellwk/CSSConf.Asia-animating-svg\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
