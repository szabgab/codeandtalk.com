You've heard the rumors: designing emails means coding like it’s the year 2000, creating tables and adding styles inline, and throwing best practices and hopes of compatibility out the window. BREATHE. In this session, get your emails in shape for 2016 and ready for the responsive spotlight! We’ll see: \n\n- Why you need a reusable, maintainable template and how to design one.\n- When and how to use media queries and the ever controversial !important.\n- What vendors and properties require CSS prefixes\n- How to make desktop, mobile, and web-based clients play nicely with your code, and which ones to watch out for.\n\nJennifer is a self taught web developer. She spends her days on the front end, making the web a prettier and more functional place.
