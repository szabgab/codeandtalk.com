    "description": "Container Camp SF 2016 - https://container.camp\n\nUnikernels are a powerful new technique for generating compact, isolated containers with minimal surface area. But like all powerful tools, their benefits and disadvantages must be carefully weighed. Are unikernels worth the tradeoffs required? \n\nIn this talk, we'll try to answer this question by providing a brief introduction to unikernels, show you how to build your own, and explaining the most important considerations of running them in the real world.\n\nJohn Feminella is an avid technologist, occasional public speaker, and frequent instigator of assorted shenanigans. He serves as a technical advisor for Pivotal, and he recently co-founded UpHex, a startup providing analytics management for digital agencies and their clients. He lives in Charlottesville, VA and likes meta-jokes, milkshakes, and referring to himself in the third person in speaker bios.",
