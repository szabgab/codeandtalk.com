    "description": "Container Camp SF 2016 - http://container.camp/\n\nCynthia Thomas - Systems Engineer at Midokura \n\nThis is a call to all who want to deploy production-grade networking for container-based workloads. With the adoption of container orchestration engines like Swarm, Kubernetes and Mesos, it’s important to adapt security technologies that scale with growing deployments. If we can isolate workloads with overlays, that’s pretty good. If we can seal a container on a host, that’s great! \n\nKuryr and MidoNet open source projects achieve network security for containers in a simplified, distributed architecture. Removing architectural bottlenecks, Kuryr + MidoNet efficiently implements security policies through the hardened Neutron framework for use by containers in large scale environments.",
