Is that really science fiction, or have we been doing it wrong all along? What can we learn from sci-fi movies\u2014and the sources that inspired them\u2014about building applications today? Is it possible to build apps that deploy, scale, and self-heal on any infrastructure? \n\nCasey Bisson, Joyent\u2019s Director of Product, will demonstrate how application centric orchestration\u2014the preferred pattern for applications in science fiction\u2014can work in the real world, and how it\u2019s older and more tested than we might think.",
