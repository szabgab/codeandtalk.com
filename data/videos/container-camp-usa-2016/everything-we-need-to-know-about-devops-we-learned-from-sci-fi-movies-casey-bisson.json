Is that really science fiction, or have we been doing it wrong all along? What can we learn from sci-fi movies—and the sources that inspired them—about building applications today? Is it possible to build apps that deploy, scale, and self-heal on any infrastructure? \n\nCasey Bisson, Joyent’s Director of Product, will demonstrate how application centric orchestration—the preferred pattern for applications in science fiction—can work in the real world, and how it’s older and more tested than we might think.",
