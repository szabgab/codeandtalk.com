AT is an often an effective solution to keep learners with disabilities \"engaged and responsible\" for their own classwork and keeps them performing at levels more accurate to their real potential throughout their educational careers. This presenter will briefly discuss why AT is often overlooked as a support to enhance learner participation; describe the challenges of functionally incorporating AT into the classroom as depicted through real case studies; and provide an overview of effective AT tools used for individuals with disabilities. \n\nSpeaker Bio ATHelp.org @marksurabian \nMark Surabian founded ATHelp.org, an assistive technology website and an associated free clinic in NYC which serves children and adults with communication, vision, learning, and physical challenges.
