    "description": "Accessibility Camp NYC - Sep 17 2016\n\nMichele Friedner and Jamie Osborne - Accessing the Black Box of Accessibility?: Notes from Research in India\n\nWe are a medical anthropologist (Michele) and a city planner (Jamie) who work in urban India. In this talk we discuss both state and civil society efforts to advance \"accessibility\" of the built environment in India and we critically engage with what it means to label something \"accessible\" or \"inaccessible.\" We draw on ethnographic and policy research and practice in order to argue that the concept of accessibility needs to be nuanced. \n\nSpeaker Bios https://healthtechnology.stonybrookmedicine.edu/programs/hrs/about/faculty/friedner Michele Friedner is an assistant professor at Stony Brook University in the School of Health Technology and Management. Jamie Osborne is a city and transit planner working at New York City Department of Transportation.\n\n\nABOUT ACCESSIBILITY CAMP\nNew York Cityâ€™s second accessibility camp was hosted at NYU MAGNET2 Metrotech Center (Brooklyn, NY 11201) on Saturday September 17, 2016. Focusing on users with different disabilities, sessions covered digital accessibility topics from the web (technical to tactical), desktop software, assistive technology, hacking, education, elections, and everything in between.",
