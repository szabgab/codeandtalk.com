    "description": "Accessibility Camp NYC - Sep 17 2016\n\nWhat's the state of the art on accessible elections? We'll look at work to make information about voting easier to read and accessible for all - from voter registration to voter guides to voting systems. There are some great developments towards the promise of the Help America Vote Act, and places where good advocacy is still needed. I'll end with some ideas for how you can make elections more accessible and be an effective self-advocate. \n\nSpeaker Bio http://civicdesign.org @civicdesign @whitneyq Whitney is co-director for the Center for Civic Design, which wants every interaction with government to be an easy, effective experience.
