That is flat out wrong.\nA developer transitioning to a managerial position might find herself in one of the most difficult positions for a manager: a new team, managing people who until recently were her co-workers. Most tech companies offer very little, if any, training for first-time managers; without the tools, training, or even having a clue as to what their job is, it's no wonder that many first-time managers fail. Yet we as an industry keep putting ourselves in this dangerous position, where failure can have catastrophic effects on the organization as well as the people involved.\nIn this talk I will discuss some of the mistakes we\u2019ve made at Wix and the system we\u2019re working on to support managers making their first steps including coaching, training and teaching.",
