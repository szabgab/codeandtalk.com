    "description": "I've spent most of life amongst storytellers in journalism, stage and screen. I've spent the last two hiring and working with great engineers at Wisdo.com. It's my profound belief that great code writers are artists in soul and practice and that the architecture of stories can and should be taught to those who spend more of their days - solving stories rather than writing them. Code needs to serve a greater purpose. Stories provide that greater purpose efficiently. Finally, engineers who want to take the leap and become co founders - will need to know how to walk into a room, and make that room listen. There's a shape to that that can be taught.",
