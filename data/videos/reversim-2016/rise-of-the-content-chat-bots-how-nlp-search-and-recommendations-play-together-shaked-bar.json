    "description": "Chat bots are the latest AI trend, featuring bots that do anything from ordering flowers to being your lawyer.\nIn this session I will present a content chatbot and how it is built.\n\nThe synergy between NLP, search and Outbrain's recommendation algorithms enables us to understand the user\u2019s information need from the chat, and respond with relevant and timely content.\n\nThese play together in building a user friendly bot, where one can get the latest headlines, receive user-specific recommendations, and ask in natural language about specific topics or categories such as \u201cDonald Trump\u201d or \u201cSports\u201d\n.\nThe talk will describe how within a few weeks we took the idea from inception to being demonstrated by Mark Zuckerberg in his keynote in Facebook\u2019s Developer Conference. We overcame the technological and algorithmic challenges in developing the content bot, yet are still surprised by some of the bizarre inputs users enter in the bot, some of which we will share.",
