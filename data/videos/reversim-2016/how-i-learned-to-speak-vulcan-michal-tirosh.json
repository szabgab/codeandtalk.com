    "description": "I started work at Klarna four years ago, and for the first time in my life I was surrounded by developers all day long. I found myself feeling like Captain Kirk when he first met Spock.\nI'll tell you a bit about working with developers from my personal perspective.\nI'll share the things I've learned about you, the differences between people in HR and developers, and talk about what we can do to make our work together better.",
