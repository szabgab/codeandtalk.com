    "description": "Abstract\nReact Native holds great promise in terms of excellent developer experience with Javascript and code reuse between platforms. The big question is  —  do these benefits come at the price of performance? How well can React Native hold its own against purely native implementations?\n\nBackground\nI’ve been developing native mobile apps professionally for the past 7 years. I’ve seen many magical “cross-platform” solutions but eventually nothing beats pure-native in terms of app quality. The main thing developers are skeptical of is performance. React Native is unique in its ability to achieve amazing performance, but it requires developers to understand what goes on under the hood. The aim of this talk is to ease concerns for new-comers and teach existing developers a few important guidelines.",
