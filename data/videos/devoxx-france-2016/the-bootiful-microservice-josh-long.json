    "description": "We get it already! Microservices help you build smaller, singly-focused services, quicker. They scale out. They\u2019re more agile because individual teams can deliver them at their own pace. They work well in the cloud because they\u2019re smaller, and benefit from elastic, horizontal scaling. But what about the complexity? There\u2019s a cost associated with adding services and coordinating the interactions between them. In this talk, we\u2019ll look at Spring Cloud, which builds atop Spring Boot and the Netflix OSS stack, and see how it lets you easily integrate service-discovery, security, reliability patterns like the circuit breaker, and centralized and journaled property configuration (and more) to more quickly build microservices that scale.\n\nJoin Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long to find out what Netflix, Alibaba, Ticketmaster, and countless other organizations already know: Spring Cloud handles the non-functional requirements associated with adopting microservices to enable them to progress quickly.",
