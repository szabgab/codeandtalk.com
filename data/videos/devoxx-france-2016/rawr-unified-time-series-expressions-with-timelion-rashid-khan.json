    "description": "Elasticsearch. Graphite. Public data APIs. Some garbage someone invented to torture you. There's interfaces to unify them, but they require you learn each and every backend's special language. And you have to hope they all have the same functions which, tip, they do not. Who's got time for that? Timelion operates at a higher level. Not only can it display time series from multiple data source types, it can perform computations across them. Timelion expressions are chainable, groupable, reusable and source agnostic, and every function and feature works with every data source.",
