    "description": "Kubernetes is a powerful, open source, container orchestration / cluster management tool created by Google. It drew upon all the lessons learned from a near-decade of using containers at Google. In this session, we'll look beyond container orchestration with Kubernetes, but also taking a deep dive into more advanced feature such as autoscaling. But its most powerful feature is its versatile REST API which you can use to tailor Kubernetes to your needs.\n\nIn addition to the Kubernetes Autoscaler, We'll look at: - How to access the Kubernetes API securely - The different Kubernetes resources, such as Pod, Replication Controller, Service, etc. - How to update/manage your entire cluster using the API\n\nWe'll demonstrate all of the concepts via a custom autoscaler that scales a stateful application using custom metrics, such as Infinispan!",
