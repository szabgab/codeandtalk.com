Let's try to follow their advice and see where it lands us.\n\nWe'll take four journeys from rails new into a reasonable future. The first three, \u201cdedicated team pulling apart the monolith a year later than hoped\u201d, \"nothin' beats a monolith\", \"services from day one\" will blow up the Enterprise, while the fourth, \u201ctake reasonable steps to let the system evolve\u201d, won't.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Je9Q/",
