    "description": "Can Time-Travel Keep You From Blowing Up The Enterprise? by David Copeland\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and there's a lot of advice out there telling you to do what the author wishes they had done at their last company to avoid disaster. Let's try to follow their advice and see where it lands us.\n\nWe'll take four journeys from rails new into a reasonable future. The first three, “dedicated team pulling apart the monolith a year later than hoped”, \"nothin' beats a monolith\", \"services from day one\" will blow up the Enterprise, while the fourth, “take reasonable steps to let the system evolve”, won't.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Je9Q/",
