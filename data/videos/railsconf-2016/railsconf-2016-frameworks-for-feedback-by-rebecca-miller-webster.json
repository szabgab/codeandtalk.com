    "description": "Frameworks for Feedback by Rebecca Miller-Webster\n\nCode reviews, stand ups, retros, and performance reviews acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback, but they don\u2019t help you give negative feedback or ensure that you hear the small things before they become big things.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about feedback and examine frameworks for how to ask for and frame feedback effectively. Not all situations call for the same type of feedback and some are more sensitive than others. We will look at Non-Violent Communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JdjY/",
