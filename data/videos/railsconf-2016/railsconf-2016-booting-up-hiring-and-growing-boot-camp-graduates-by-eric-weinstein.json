    "description": "Booting Up: Hiring and Growing Boot Camp Graduates by Eric Weinstein\n\nIn 2015, nearly a hundred programming boot camps produced thousands of graduates in North America alone. While boot camps help address a need for professional software developers, their graduates have different skill sets and require different interview assessment and career management than fresh college graduates with degrees in computer science. In this talk, we'll look at how boot camps prepare their students, how to interview graduates, and how to help them continually learn during their careers, developing a holistic model for hiring and growing boot camp graduates in the process.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J48Q/",
