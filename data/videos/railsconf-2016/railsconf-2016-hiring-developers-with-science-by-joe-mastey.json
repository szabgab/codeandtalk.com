    "description": "Hiring Developers, with Science! by Joe Mastey\n\nNothing makes or breaks our teams like the members they hire. And so we rate and quiz, assign homework and whiteboard algorithms until candidates are blue in the face. But does it work? In this session, we’ll unpack common interviews and how they stack up with research into predicting performance. We’ll learn to design interviews that work, what kinds don’t work at all, and how to tell the difference, with science!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J4DG/",
