    "description": "Style Documentation for the Resource-Limited by Betsy Haibel\n\nApplication view layers are always hard to manage. Usually we handwave this as the natural consequence of views being where fuzzy user experience and designer brains meet the cleaner, neater logic of computers and developers. But that handwave can be misleading. View layers are hard to manage because they’re the part of a system where gaps in a team’s interdisciplinary collaboration become glaring. A comprehensive, well-documented styleguide and component library is a utopian ideal. Is it possible to actually get there? It is, and we can do it incrementally with minimal refactor hell.",
