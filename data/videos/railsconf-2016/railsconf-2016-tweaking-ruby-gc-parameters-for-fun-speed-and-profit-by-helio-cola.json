The stats exposed by the Garbage Collector since Ruby v2.1 caught my attention and pushed me to dig deeper. Both Ruby 2.1 and 2.2 brought great performance improvements. From a practical point of view, we will discuss how to use the GC to enhance the performance of your software, from configuration parameters to different approaches on how you can change them yourself.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Jv6O/",
