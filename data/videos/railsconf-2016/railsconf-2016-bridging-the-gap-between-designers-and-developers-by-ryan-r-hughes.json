    "description": "Bridging the Gap between Designers and Developers by Ryan R Hughes\n\nEvery project...well most projects...begin in a great kumbaya where everyone is great friends and has high hopes for the future. About halfway through the project, an epic Braveheart style clash begins, with designers firmly lined up on one side and developers on the other.\n\nIn this talk, I'll share some of the things we've discovered over years of working on projects for over 100 clients that have helped to better define requirements and meet the needs of designers and developers throughout the life of a project.",
