    "description": "Pragmatic Lessons of Rails & Ruby in the Enterprise by Nathan Beyer\n\nAdopting Rails and Ruby for use within a large development organization was and continues to be an adventure. Rails and Ruby have been in use at Cerner for 7 years and over that time, their use has gone from niche technology used by a handful of people to a core platform used by hundreds. Along this adventure, we have learned many lessons and gained lots of experience. In this talk, we\u2019ll share the interesting up and downs of this adventure in an effort to share our experiences and knowledge.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Jkon/",
