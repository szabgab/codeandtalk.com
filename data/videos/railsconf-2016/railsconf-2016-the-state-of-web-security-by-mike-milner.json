    "description": "Join me for a wild ride through the dizzying highs and terrifying lows of web security in 2015. Take a look at some major breaches of the year, from Top Secret clearances, to medical records, all the way to free beer. We\u2019ll look at how attack trends have changed over the past year and new ways websites are being compromised. We\u2019ve pulled together data from all the sites we protect to show you insights on types and patterns of attacks, and sophistication and origin of the attackers. After the bad, we\u2019ll look at the good - new technologies like U2F and RASP that are helping secure the web.",
