    "description": "Just like there’s an app for that, there’s an API for that! But not all APIs are created equal, and some APIs are harder to work with than others. In this talk, I will walk through some common gotchas developers encounter when consuming a 3rd party API. I will explain why it’s important to familiarize yourself with the API you’re consuming prior to coding, as well as share tools to help you get acquainted with an API much faster. Lastly, I will go over debugging and testing the API you’re consuming, because testing is not just for the provider of the API!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JUpK/",
