  "description": "Just like there\u2019s an app for that, there\u2019s an API for that! But not all APIs are created equal, and some APIs are harder to work with than others.

I will explain why it\u2019s important to familiarize yourself with the API you\u2019re consuming prior to coding, as well as share tools to help you get acquainted with an API much faster. Lastly, I will go over debugging and testing the API you\u2019re consuming, because testing is not just for the provider of the API!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JUpK/",
