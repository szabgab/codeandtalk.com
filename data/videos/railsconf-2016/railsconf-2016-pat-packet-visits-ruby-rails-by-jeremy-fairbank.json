    "description": "The eager Pat Packet just started his first job at KPS (Kernel Parcel Service). He knows an important package is coming through from Firechrome Industries destined for the Puma Kingdom for Ruby Rails herself! Pat’s boss acquiesces to Pat’s pleas to deliver the package. Come follow Pat’s journey as he delivers this very important package to Ruby Rails!\n\nWhether we realize it or not, a lot of magic goes behind the scenes to deliver an HTTP request from a browser to a Rails server. In this talk, learn about TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, routers, and much more as they help Pat Packet deliver his package.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JvLn/",
