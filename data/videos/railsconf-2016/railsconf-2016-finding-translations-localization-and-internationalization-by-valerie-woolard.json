    "description": "Translation, be it a word, sentence, concept, or idea, for different audiences has always been a challenge. This talk tackles problems of translation, especially those that tend to crop up in building software. We'll dive into the eminently practical—how to design apps for easier localization, common pitfalls, solutions for managing translations, approaches to version control with translations—and the more subjective—possible impacts of cultural differences, and what makes a \"good\" translation.",
