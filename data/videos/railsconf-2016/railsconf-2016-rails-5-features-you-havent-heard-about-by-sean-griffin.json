    "description": "Rails 5 Features You Haven't Heard About by Sean Griffin\n\nWe've all heard about Action Cable, Turbolinks 5, and Rails::API. But Rails 5 was almost a thousand commits! They included dozens of minor features, many of which will be huge quality of life improvements even if you aren't using WebSockets or Turbolinks.\n\nThis will be a deep look at several of the \"minor\" features of Rails 5. You won't just learn about the features, but you'll learn about why they were added, the reasoning behind them, and the difficulties of adding them from someone directly involved in many of them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J5Cj/",
