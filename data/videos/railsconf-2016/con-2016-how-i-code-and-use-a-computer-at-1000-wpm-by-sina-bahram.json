    "description": "How I Code and Use a Computer at 1,000 WPM!! By Sina Bahram\n\nI use a computer very differently than most people, because I'm blind. When I'm surfing the web, tweeting, checking email, reading the news, and writing code, I'm doing so because a program called a screen reader is reading me what's on the screen. I happen to listen to it read me this text at a thousand words per minute! Join me in listening to how I experience some common user interfaces. Yes, I'll slow it down for you. I also have a challenge for everyone in the audience. Can you get through a day only using the keyboard? What about not looking at your screen?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KWNs/",
