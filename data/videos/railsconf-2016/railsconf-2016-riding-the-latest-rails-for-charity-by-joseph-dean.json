    "description": "As developers we often forget that with our development skills we have the power to change the world. This talk describes how our company organized a hackathon to create three open source projects that helped charitable organizations become more efficient at helping people. Bringing our team together around a shared philanthropic goal created more team unity, improved team communication and most importantly allowed us to apply our development skills to do good in the world.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JcYy/",
