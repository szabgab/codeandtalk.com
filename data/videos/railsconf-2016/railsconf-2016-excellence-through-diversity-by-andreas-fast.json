    "description": "Excellence Through Diversity by Andreas Fast\n\nGreat individuals often outperform their peers, and when going through school and applying for jobs this seems to be the most important aspect. But who is really outperforming whom? Also, what are we using to measure people? How do you know you\u2019re being fair?
