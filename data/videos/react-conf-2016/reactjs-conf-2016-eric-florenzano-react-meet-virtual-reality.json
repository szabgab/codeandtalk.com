  "description": "After a short moment in the 90s, Virtual Reality faded away. Now in 2016, VR is coming back in a big way. Games are leading the charge, but with millions of headsets pouring into the marketplace over the next few years, how can React web and app developers get involved? Can React even handle the screaming-fast performance requirements of VR? Spoiler: it can.\n\nThis talk explores these concepts by incrementally building up a mobile VR engine that can be driven not just with JavaScript, but with React. We'll discover how naive approaches fail, and why game engines are built the way they are. Finally, we'll cover some exciting work with WebVR which intends to bring VR to all browsers.",
