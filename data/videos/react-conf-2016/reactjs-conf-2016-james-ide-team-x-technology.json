    "description": "With React Native, mobile developers are able to increase both their productivity and scope of work. The cross-platform technology is fantastic for teams building for Android and iOS, and developers can take ownership of products & features instead of single-platform implementations.\n\nAt Exponent we've extended this idea to include both products and infrastructure. I'll talk a bit about how we apply this to our software development and the benefits and challenges of growing full-stack developers into cross-stack mobile developers who are responsible for Android and iOS.",
