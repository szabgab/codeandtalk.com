    "description": "React isn't yet-another-JavaScript-framework \u2014 it's a paradigm shift in the way UIs are engineered. If in ten years we're no longer using React, we'll likely be using something similar. You can already see this in how pre-React libraries like Ember and Angular have pivoted in the wake of React's two big innovations: a declarative component model, and unidirectional data flow.\n\nBut it's even more clear when looking at the post-React libraries, which use functional programming concepts to provide powerful architectures for state management. In this talk, I'll show how we can steal some of the best ideas from Om, Cycle, and Elm, and use them in our React applications.",
