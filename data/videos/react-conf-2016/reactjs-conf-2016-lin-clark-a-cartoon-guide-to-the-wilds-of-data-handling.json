  "description": "I'm going to walk you through the wilds of data handling in react. I call it \u201cthe wilds\u201d because when you first look at the landscape, it seems to be overflowing with an untamed profusion of different options. The boundaries between these options aren't clear, and it's hard to see why you'd want to pick any one in particular.\n\nWhen you look closer, you'll see that it's actually easier to navigate than you might think. You just need a good guide.",
