  "description": "gl-react is a universal library for implementing advanced filters and effects on top of images, videos, text or any VDOM Content (such as UI Views) - without having to deal with the imperative and low-level OpenGL and WebGL APIs. Because they are defined as simple React components, complex arrangements can be composed using the VDOM descriptive paradigm.\n\ngl-react hides OpenGL's statefulness and exposes its greatest functional feature: GLSL (an expressive 'functional rendering' language) and its rendering pipeline that runs on the GPU. Effects such as blur, saturation, color rotation and tinting, image composition, noise,... can all be implemented easily. But OpenGL is extremely powerful, unlocking the potential for spectacular effects and UI components: image deformation, localized blur using depth map, normal map effects, and more.",
