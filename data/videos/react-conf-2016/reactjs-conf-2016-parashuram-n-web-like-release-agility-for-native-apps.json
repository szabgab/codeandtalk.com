    "description": "React Native brought the web's enviable debug cycle to mobile, without needing to sacrifice native UI to get there. While this makes for an amazing dev experience, your apps are still ultimately distributed through stores, and therefore, canâ€™t immediately take advantage of the same release agility that is typically associated with web dev. But that doesn't have to be the case!\n\nWhether you are doing distributions within your team, amongst your clients or to your entire consumer base, getting improvements out to users as quickly as possible, and monitoring its impact on usage/satisfaction, can be critical to success. This talk will show how easy it can be to setup an automated build pipeline and release continous app deployments via services like VSTS, HockeyApp and CodePush.",
