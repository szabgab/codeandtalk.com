  "description": "Plain text is boring. At Facebook, we want to give our users the ability to add mentions, emoticons, hashtags, styles, and embedded media within the content they share. The result is that nearly every input on Facebook requires rich text features.\n\nAs UI engineers, we want to provide our product teams with the tools to implement and expand upon these features without pushing them into the contentEditable pit of despair.\n\nThis talk will dive into the details of how we used React, ImmutableJS, and yes, contentEditable, to create an editor framework that enables engineers to build and customize rich text composition experiences across Facebook.",
