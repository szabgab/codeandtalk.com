  "description": "React re-thought best practices for web and native development, but it is limited by the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript.\n\nElm takes rethinking best practices even further by asking what a modern language designed for productive development should look like.\n\nSignals and the Elm Architecture help you compose large complex applications out of small, understandable pieces. Elm's powerful type system and emphasis on pure functions and immutable data make refactoring and maintaining large applications faster and easier.\n\nElm and React share common ideas, and creating a new language helps Elm leverage those ideas in to a better development experience. Learn how Elm can make you a better React developer, and maybe, just maybe, take the plunge in to trying Elm yourself.",
