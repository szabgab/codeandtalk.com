    "description": "Search-index is a module for doing free-text search in Javascript. In this talk we will explore various approaches to indexing data on the server and in the browser. We will show how search-index integrates with other technologies presented at WebRebels such as Browserify, the Level family, PouchDB and NPM, together with code examples. The talk should serve as a jumping off point for engineers looking to use search-index, and creative types who want to create new concepts around \"Small Data\".",
