    "description": "How to deliver apps faster while reducing risks (at the same time!)\n\nDevSecOps provides great ideas and tools to apply the “shift to the left” paradigm in order to reduce the risks of an automated software/service delivery process. But software runs on an infrastructure consisting of servers/containers AND their associated firewall policies. That means that while server/container delivery is agile,firewall policies are still enforced in a highly manual and error-prone process. And Change Workflow systems are not here to help. Imposing controls is a nice way to reduce the risks, but not at the expense of agility… because at the end of the day that means higher cost of delivery. In this talk you will learn how Application Delivery, SecOps, and Risk teams can work together to massively improve the cost while reducing risks. At the same time!",
