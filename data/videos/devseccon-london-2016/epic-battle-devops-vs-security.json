    "description": "Security has traditionally been in the business of saying “no”. Then along came DevOps with its “yes, Yes, YES!” attitude. Now organisations are faced with the challenge of innovating at the velocity and scale that DevOps allows, but at the same time limiting exposure to old and new risks.\n\nThis talk looks at what happens when DevOps and Security collide. We’ll alternate between traditional security and DevOps perspectives, looking at the pros, cons and risks. Is DevSecOps the solution? Is it part of a bigger picture? What does leaving traditional security behind really mean? We look at these questions and more.",
