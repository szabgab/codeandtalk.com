    "description": "A DevSecCon London 2016 talk by Nick Jones\n\nMany will likely have seen or used static analysis tools in the past, but they\u2019re often poorly understood. This talk covers the theory behind a number of the techniques commonly used to analyze applications, including taint checking and analysis of control flow graphs and field initializations. \n\nAfter covering the benefits and pitfalls that these techniques bring to the table, it then goes on to address how to best fit these tools into your development environment and infrastructure, demonstrate how to catch software bugs early in your development cycle and how analysis may be applied to infrastructure as code definitions.",
