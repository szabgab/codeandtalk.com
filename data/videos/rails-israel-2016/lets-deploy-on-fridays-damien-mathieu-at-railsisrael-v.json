    "description": "How do you deploy sensitive changes to your app? What if you have to entirely replace a production component with another, all without any customer impact?\n\nEarlier this year, we rewrote an internal component which was old, had poor testing and where implementing changes was always long and risky. There had previously been several attempts at it which all failed. In this presentation, we will see why those previous attempts failed, why this one succeeded as well as several patterns to succeed with this kind of rewrites.",
