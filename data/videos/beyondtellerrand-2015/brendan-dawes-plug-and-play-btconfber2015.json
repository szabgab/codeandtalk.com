In this session Brendan Dawes takes you through his approach to making things; things made for himself as well as things made for clients, often sharing the same question – “how the hell am I going to make that?” From hardware to software and everything in-between Brendan shows how curiosity and a thirst to learn new things drives him on to become a better maker of things.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2015/speakers/brendan-dawes\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
