More and more it\u2019s getting harder to describe someone who makes things in the 21st Century. To Brendan Dawes a modern day designer can be equally comfortable creating a CRON job on the server as easily as creating a baseline grid. In this session Brendan Dawes takes you through his approach to making things; things made for himself as well as things made for clients, often sharing the same question \u2013 \u201chow the hell am I going to make that?\u201d From hardware to software and everything in-between Brendan shows how curiosity and a thirst to learn new things drives him on to become a better maker of things.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2015/speakers/brendan-dawes\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
