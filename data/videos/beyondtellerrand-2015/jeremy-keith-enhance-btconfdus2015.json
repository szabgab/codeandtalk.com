    "description": "We\u2019re working on increasingly complex websites. There\u2019s a temptation to match this growth with increasingly complex solutions. But there\u2019s a real value in keeping things simple...or at least starting things simple. If you can build a solid robust foundation, there\u2019s a good chance that your work will be future-friendly. Prepare to have your brain subtly rewired as we look beneath the surface-level implementation details of the web to reveal the semantic structure below. Whether you\u2019re publishing content or building the latest hot app, the principle of progressive enhancement will change the way you think about your work.",
