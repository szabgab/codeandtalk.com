    "description": "Some people say the web is dying, but I believe it’s just getting started. And what will kick it into overdrive is the Physical Web: the ability to discover, engage, and interact with smart devices (or that “dumb” tree over there) using nothing more than a browser.\n\nIn this (highly speculative) presentation, I’ll explore the impact these new capabilities will have on the way we design and think about this (increasingly near) future web.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2015/speakers/stephanie-rieger\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
