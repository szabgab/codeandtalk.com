From grey backgrounds to font tags and tables, from simple style sheets to responsive sites, from 640x480 to the thousands of screen sizes we encounter today, the march of progress continues.\n\nBut as we move forward, it's useful to consider lessons from the past. And that's a rapidly-fading past; links rot. References fade. Information disappears. During a career that started during the Browser Wars, Dave has seen a lot of it first hand, and would like to reminisce about how things were so we can avoid repeating past mistakes.",
