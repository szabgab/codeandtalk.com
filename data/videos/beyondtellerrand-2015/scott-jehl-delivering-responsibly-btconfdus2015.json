    "description": "Delivering Responsibly\n\nBuilding responsively allows us to create flexible user interfaces that support the widest possible audience with a single front-end codebase. But in embracing the ever-increasing contexts in which our sites are used, performance and accessibility must remain our highest priorities; we must continually question each code addition, and improve our delivery and application techniques to ensure they’re best serving users’ needs.\n\nThis talk will explore the challenges of creating fast and broadly-accessible websites and offer approaches that dramatically improve performance, usability, access, and sustainability.",
