Social media has triggered this boom and has influenced the appearance of many who make a go of lettering professionally. But how to tell good from bad? In my keynote I put together several criteria that can help designers to identify and filter good quality lettering pieces from the stream of typographic pieces out there. The talk will give a broad overview over the art, including defining what is lettering and what is not, what is the difference with type design and will walk you through the working process of a lettering artist including analog and digital tools.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2015/speakers/scott-jenson\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
