    "description": "Advancing the web without breaking it?\n\nDevelopment for the web has become much more complex in recent years. We have lots of tools, the languages we use evolve and there is a constant call that we now \"build apps, not web sites\" and thus we need to change our ways.\n\nIn this talk Chris Heilmann of Microsoft is going to talk about ES6 and other technologies and how to use them without breaking the web as we know it.",
