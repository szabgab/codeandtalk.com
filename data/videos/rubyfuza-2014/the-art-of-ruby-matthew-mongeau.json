    "description": "We should all be artists in our craft, but there is a balance between expressiveness and performance. This talk is about finding that balance and producing beautiful code that doesn't sacrifice syntax for speed. I'll explore real world examples of code and mold them into something far more expressive. During the process we'll take a look at how common design patterns are applied to larger applications and examine the repercussions.\n\nShot by Just Shoot Me Digital - http://www.jsmdigital.co.za/\nMusic is Coma's U Dub by Nokom electro - http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/39238/coma-s-u-dub",
