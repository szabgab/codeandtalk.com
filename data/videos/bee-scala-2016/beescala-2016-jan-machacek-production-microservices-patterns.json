    "description": "This talk was recorded at BeeScala 2016 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Follow along on Twitter @BeeScalaConf and on the website for more information http://bee-scala.org.\n\nAbstract:\n\nJan will talk about microservice messaging patterns applied, with an example in Scala, Kafka, Cassandra and Deelpearning4j. We will build a system that turns tweeted images into stories, using CNNs and RNNs. We will have a distributed domain in Akka / Scala with storage in Apache Cassandra, computer vision components in Deeplearning4j; all connected with Kafka.\nThe talk will show the architectural and code smells that were the result of half-harted reactive implementation and the way to address them.\n\nNOTE: This session was recorded via Skype due to Lufthansa strike which prevented Jan to attend the conference in person. Thank you for your effort.",
