Follow along on Twitter @BeeScalaConf and on the website for more information http://bee-scala.org.\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this talk we will describe an experience of spending several months using Scala.js in real project. Why Scala.js was chosen, what worked well and what obstacles were encountered, what Scala.js ecosystem already has today and whatâ€™s still missing. It is a pragmatic session for people considering Scala.js for their project or people interested in Scala.js in general.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/katrinsh\nhttps://github.com/katrinsharp/scalajs-examples",
