    "description": "This talk was recorded at BeeScala 2016 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Follow along on Twitter @BeeScalaConf and on the website for more information http://bee-scala.org.\n\nAbstract:\n\nEvolutionary algorithms open windows to where machines and biology meet. In this talk we’ll explore how evolutionary algorithms mimic and borrow from the way that Mother Nature solves problems – the road, from solving puzzles, to social sciences, to designing new kinds of satellite antennas. We’ll see how we can use plain Scala to code evolutionary algorithms, and see the existing libraries that can help us save some time.",
