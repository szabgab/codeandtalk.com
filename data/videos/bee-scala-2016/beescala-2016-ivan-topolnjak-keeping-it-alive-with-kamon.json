    "description": "This talk was recorded at BeeScala 2016 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Follow along on Twitter @BeeScalaConf and on the website for more information http://bee-scala.org.\n\nAbstract:\n\nBeing able to monitor your application’s behavior is nice; knowing that everything is being measured and reported somewhere makes you feel like you are doing the right thing, but, are you? Simply measuring everything like there is no tomorrow doesn’t bring any good unless you are analyzing that data! In this talk we will learn how to interpret the metrics data collected by Kamon and how to apply this knowledge when troubleshooting real world performance problems.",
