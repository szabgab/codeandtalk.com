    "description": "Last year we read a lot about ES6, or ES2015. Some have started using it using Babel or other tools, and browsers have started implementing it. But what about the new stuff happening this year? What about ES2016 (and further)? And how can you keep up to date by understanding the spec and it\u2019s different stages?\n\nIn my talk I\u2019m going to discuss the small new feature set of ES2016, and what might be coming in future version. I\u2019ll also be taking you through the ECMA-262 specification process.",
