    "description": "Last year we read a lot about ES6, or ES2015. Some have started using it using Babel or other tools, and browsers have started implementing it. But what about the new stuff happening this year? What about ES2016 (and further)? And how can you keep up to date by understanding the spec and it’s different stages?\n\nIn my talk I’m going to discuss the small new feature set of ES2016, and what might be coming in future version. I’ll also be taking you through the ECMA-262 specification process.",
