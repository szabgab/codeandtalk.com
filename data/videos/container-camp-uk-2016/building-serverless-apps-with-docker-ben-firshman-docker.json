For good reason \u2013 it's makes distributed apps much simpler to build, scale, and maintain. But what's the best way to start using it in practice? \n\nUsing Docker, you can mix in serverless techniques into your application today. I will show you how to do this and also delve a bit into how serverless is going to change how you build distributed apps in the future.\n\nBen is the director of product management at Docker where he created Docker Compose.
