    "description": "Rust is a systems language ready for IoT. In this talk, we\u2019ll learn how to move servos, make sensor measurements, and speak low-level communication protocols like SPI and I2C. When joined with high-level HTTP libraries, audiences will leave knowing how to create a fault-tolerant embedded device that\u2019s accessible from the cloud. Examples use the Rust language and target the Tessel microcontroller platform.\n\n---\nFor more go to https://rustfest.eu or follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rustfest\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/2FiY/",
