    "description": "A hobby can be defined as any regular activity, that someone engages in for enjoyment. Activities range from artistic crafts, playing an instrument, making homemade food and drink to collecting strange items \u2026or experimenting with code. With continuous practice the hobbyist will acquire significant skill and knowledge in a particular field, which allows him or her to apply it in a serious manner.\n\nHobby-oriented programming not only defines developer types (amateur and professional), but furthermore explores the correlation between a programmer\u2019s happiness and leisure time activities.\n\n---\nFor more go to https://rustfest.eu or follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rustfest\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/2FiM/",
