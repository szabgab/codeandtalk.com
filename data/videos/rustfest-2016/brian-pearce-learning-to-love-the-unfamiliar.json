    "description": "Coming from Ruby, JS, Python or another language? Exploring new languages can be toilsome. Rust is no different. You’ll find new idioms and features that could be unfamiliar to navigate. You might even detest them at first; comparing it to how you’d prefer it in your favourite language.\n\nWe will learn to navigate your transition into the Rust landscape. Introduce practices that might not make sense at first. See comparisons of how you may have done things, and how we can improve those practices with Rust.\n\n---\nFor more go to https://rustfest.eu or follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rustfest\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/2FiV/",
