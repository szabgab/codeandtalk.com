    "description": "Scope management is critical to the success of software development efforts. Scope is the summary of things we want the software to accomplish - and a constant opportunity and negotiation around the details. These negotiations are a delicate dance of listening, reframing and striving for creative communication clarity.  \n\nAdd in change, which as they say, is the only constant. Toss in a dollop of differing technical approaches, and often times we\u2019re crossing our fingers that what results will be palatable.\n\nThrowing Drupal 8 into the mix  matters even more. With nearly 5 years of development and planning, an entirely new PHP standards-based layer, new front-end templating engine, and larger, more full featured \u2018drupal core,\u2019 Drupal 8 provides us an opportunity to talk about scope in a new way.\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll discuss the basics of scope and change management - ideas and techniques we\u2019ve honed in managing hundreds of software projects.  We\u2019ll then review how Drupal 8 shakes all of this up - which we see as a great opportunity to reimagine how the Drupal community considers scope. Finally, we\u2019ll play some scenarios to pull everything together. For example, if we allow the Drupal 8 core to move us away from thinking about features as \u201cmodules,\u201d what does that mean for the software we develop?",
