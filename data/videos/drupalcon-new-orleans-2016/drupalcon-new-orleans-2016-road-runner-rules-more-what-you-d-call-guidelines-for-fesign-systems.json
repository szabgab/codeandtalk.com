    "description": "Wouldn’t it be great if we could spend less time trying to style the markup we’ve been handed, and more time creating a system of smart, reusable design components?\n\nWell, we’re in luck. With the increased popularity of pattern libraries and the Twig powered flexibility we’ll be seeing in Drupal 8, we finally have the tools to create and deploy our own design systems.\n\nBut what is a design system, and how do we create them? What rules should it follow? How do I get my team on board?\n\nIn this talk I will be pulling wisdom and insight from my past two years of creating a design system for Redhat.com. I will explain what we call our “Road Runner Rules”, which influence every piece of code that we write.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you are a designer who wants to learn how to turn your visual language into a design system, or a developer who wants to create more modular components, you’ll want to sit in on this session and learn from the successes and failures of a large scale Drupal design system.\n\n\n\nAfter the talk join our team in BOF room 291 for a hands on demo with the new Pattern Builder Module",
