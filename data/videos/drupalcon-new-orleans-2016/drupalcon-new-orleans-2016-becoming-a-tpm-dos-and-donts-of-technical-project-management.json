    "description": "With everything going on in life: kids, doctor appointments, car repairs, reality show auditions, aren\u2019t we ALL really project managers? No, we are not. \"Doing several related things\" isn\u2019t a project, and being in their general vicinity isn\u2019t project management.\n\nSuccessful project managers in the Drupal world require both interpersonal skills and technical skills. Lacking either, we become panicked appointment setters or bitter ex-project managers.\n\nTwo experienced Drupal project managers will cover what skills are needed, how to really figure out what you are good at, and what to add to your toolbelt. This will include:\n\nProject lifecycle management\nAgile, Waterfall, and Phased Polaron Methodologies\nWhy Projects Fail or Succeed: Tales from The Front Lines\nDebugging Machines vs. Debugging Humans \nTools of the Technical Project Management Trade\nMetrics, Reporting, and Documentation\nIf you are a beginner you will emerge from this session with an expert\u2019s perspective on project management. You will garner the respect of all around you. You will gain authority where once there was only derision. Your words will command a respect usually entrusted only to bartenders. Your projects will be overflowing with laughter, back-slaps, moments majestic and intervals sublime.",
