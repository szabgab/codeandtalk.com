    "description": "Every major release, Dries launches a \"State of Drupal\" survey for all members of the community and Drupal ecosystem. In this core conversation, we will explore the results of the survey in more depth and focus particularly on areas that affect core development and contributors. If we have time, we may also take a look at how previous surveys influenced the direction of core up to now and discuss how we will continue that progress going forward.\n\nThis conversation is open to anyone interested in Drupal core, not just past or current core contributors.\n\nTake the State of Drupal 2016 survey now!",
