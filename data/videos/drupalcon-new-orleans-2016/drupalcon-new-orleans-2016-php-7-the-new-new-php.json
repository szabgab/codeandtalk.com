    "description": "The next era in the life of our favorite language has come.  PHP 7 brings numerous improvements to PHP, from minor syntactic enhancements to major engine changes to a new, stronger type system.\n\nWhat does it mean for developers?  What exactly are the new tools at our disposal?  Are the changes in PHP 7 worth the upgrade?
