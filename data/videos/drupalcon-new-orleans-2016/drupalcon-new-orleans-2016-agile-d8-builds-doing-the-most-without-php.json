    "description": "One of the design philosophies behind Drupal 8 is the ability to make simple things easy and complex things possible. While there is a lot of neat stuff “under the hood” with Drupal 8, this talk will discuss how you can leverage the Drupal 8 core stack to build pretty awesome websites without writing (or including) a line of custom or contributed PHP.\n\nGone are the days of needing to install several modules just to properly model your data. Gone are the days of needing to do a lot of wrangling just to get a WYSWIYG. Gone are the days of needing to install a module just to make a list of content. Gone are the days of needing custom code to export your configuration to even more custom code.\n\n\n\nCome join Matt Cheney and David Strauss from Pantheon to see some live site building on stage and learn techniques to quickly and agiling build sites for prototypes or production.",
