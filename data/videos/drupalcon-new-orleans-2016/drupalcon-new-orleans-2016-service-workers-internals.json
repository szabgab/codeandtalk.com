In this session we will dig into the foundations of services workers api with demos and code walk throughs. Also we will do a deep dive into internals to see how we can use it with Drupal 8 for a rich user experience.\n\n\n\nOutLine of this session - \n\nService Worker Standalone\n\n Background and capabilities\n\n Set up for your application\n\n Service workers - LifeCycle\n\n Updating a Service worker\n\n Browser Compatibility\n\nDemos - To show what we can do using service workers api\n\n Implementing push notifications\n\n Offline Web Experience\n\n Background Sync\n\nIntegration possibilities with Drupal 8.\n\n\nP.S -- There was lot of excitement in Service workers BoF that happened in Drupalcon Asia\n\nAudience Level - This session would be a mixed beginner and intermidiate level.",
