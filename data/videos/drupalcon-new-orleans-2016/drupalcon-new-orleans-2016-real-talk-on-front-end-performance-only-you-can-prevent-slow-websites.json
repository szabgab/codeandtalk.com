    "description": "The first wave of Drupal website performance optimization largely focused on the back-end — tuning PHP, using Varnish, Redis, Solr, etc — and the best practices are well established by now. With many of those problems more or less \"solved\", and with a majority of traffic now coming via mobile devices, front-end performance is increasingly the key to delivering a great user-experience.\n\nAchieving blazing front-end speed requires a savvy developer who knows the terrain, both on the browser/device side, and from the Drupal perspective. You can't just say, \"oh we'll put HTTP 2.0 on it and everything will be fine,\" or \"yadd yadd yadd BigPipe will take care of it.\" You have to understand what is going on, and how to apply that knowledge to optimize.\n\nThis session will look at the important tools and techniques that all website developers should know and use when constructing and optimizing. Topics include:\n\nAsynchonicity for fun and profit\nSpeeding first-byte to first paint\nProgressive enhancement\nMeaningful front-end performance testing\nRemember, only you can prevent slow websites!",
