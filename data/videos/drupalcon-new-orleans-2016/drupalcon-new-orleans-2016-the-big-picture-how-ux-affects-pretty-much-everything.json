    "description": "We often view UX as a collection of tools and techniques but UX is more than that.  Come to this session to gain a deeper and more coherent view of UX.\n\nThe User Experience Office at Princeton University is developing a comprehensive framework we call LUCID UX.  Our goal is to find a way to connect the many different elements that comprise UX and show how they fit together. As UX becomes more integrated into web and mobile design, everyone involved needs to understand and participate in the UX process. Project owners, users, project managers, and developers all contribute to the user experience and need to work effectively with UX practitioners. Even senior managers are realizing that, properly positioned, UX can drive an organization’s strategic goals.\n\nIn LUCID UX, we offer three views of UX: Process, Design and Strategy:\n\nUX Process describes the steps and flow of UX. It is based on ideas drawn from project and team management.\nUX Design focuses on how interactions, information architecture and visual design. It’s based on principles drawn from cognitive science.\nUX Strategy is concerned with how a project affects business process and how it drives organizational goals. It’s based on principles derived from organizational change and effectiveness.\nIn this session, we’ll present a high-level view of the framework so that you can think about UX in a larger sense. We’ll explain how it all fits together and share basic principles you can use from each of the three perspectives.\n\nLUCID UX is an evolving framework and we invite you to share your ideas and help us build the framework.",
