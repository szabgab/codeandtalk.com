    "description": "This is the scene: your organization\u2019s website means well. It always has. But through the years, the content on that site has piled up, grown wild, and has little rhyme or reason. It\u2019s out of control. But you\u2019re trying to make it better. You want to make it better. You need to make it better.\n\n\n\nLow quality content hurts your organization all around. It makes for poor search engine discovery. It makes it difficult for people to understand you and your products or issues. And in the worst cases, it gives your visitors the wrong idea and turns them away.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019ll discuss how to wrap your head around the content you have, and then how to whip that content into shape. During this presentation, we\u2019ll discuss:\n\nthe qualities of excellent online content -- from blog posts to headlines to images and beyond.\n\nthe nitty gritty of actually digging in and assessing your content.\n\nthe next steps of making changes to improve your content.\n\n\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll have the tools you need to go forth and finally start cleaning up what can sometimes feel like an impossible mess.",
