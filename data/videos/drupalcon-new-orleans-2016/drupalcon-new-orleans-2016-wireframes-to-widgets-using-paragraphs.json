    "description": "After embracing agile methodology, many development teams are able to quickly adapt to changing requirements. Unfortunately, however, our collective design processes have been slower to evolve. They're not agile enough to keep up with our rapid development cycles, or they require designers to have an unrealistic set of skills.\n\nDrupal 8, with its modern theming engine, will definitely make things easier. We\u2019ll highlight some of the new tools compatible with Drupal 8 (Sketch, Pattern Lab, Twig, Paragraphs, etc.) that will help in the effort to bring design processes up to speed with modern web development. \n\nBut an effective design process requires more than just tools. This session will primarily focus on process, specifically how to establish a design process that incorporates designers, UX experts, and developers. The main take-away is how the idea of prototyping and shifting our workflows can ultimately speed up the entire development cycle.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\nThe principles of collaborative design methodology\nHow to create a design workflow suited for the tools you are already using\nHow to incorporate Drupal 8\u2019s theming tools into your design workflow\nHow to sell prototyping to clients, project managers, and other stakeholders",
