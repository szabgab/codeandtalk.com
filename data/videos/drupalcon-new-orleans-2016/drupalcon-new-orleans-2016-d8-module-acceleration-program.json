    "description": "Last year Acquia commited $500k to porting modules to D8 through the Module Acceleration Program. This will be a panel discussion led by the developers on the challenges and successes of the program. We will also cover the functionality we have been able to bring to D8 with the 40+ modules that have been ported and where you can use them in your projects including:\n\nPanels, Panelizer, Chaos Tools, Page Manager\nWorkbench moderation \nWorkspace Preview System\nSearch API and other search modules\nand many more!\n There will be a long question time at the end to give you a chance to ask about architectural decisions that have been made and the future direction of the program.\n\nThis should be accessable to all levels, but even advanced developers should get alot out of the deep discusion of D8 development patterns",
