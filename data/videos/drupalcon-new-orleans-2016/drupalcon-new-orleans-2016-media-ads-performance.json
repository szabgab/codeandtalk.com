    "description": "Performance matters\u2014 we all know that. Getting content to a user is paramount, and doing it quickly is always the end goal of the web. This is even more true for media sites, where most content is shared on social media\u2014 and delivered to devices where bandwidth and data is limited. The challenges are numerous\u2014 and the stakes are high\u2014 then how do we get better performance on our sites?\n\nThis session will go over all of the performance issues we have at Vox Media\u2014 and what we have done to deliver high-quality experiences, all while making our sites faster and more efficient. We will start with how we identified the biggest issues that our sites had\u2014 images, fonts, 3rd party scripts\u2014 and what we have done, and what we are currently doing to address each performance concern.\n\nThe coup de gr\u00e2ce will be talking about ad performance on our sites. Working with 3rd party vendors to test and assess our ads. Developing internal tools to deliver better ads that we create. Assessing the impact of new ad technology\u2014 such as header bidding\u2014 on our sites. And platform changes we are doing to better deliver ads on our sites.",
