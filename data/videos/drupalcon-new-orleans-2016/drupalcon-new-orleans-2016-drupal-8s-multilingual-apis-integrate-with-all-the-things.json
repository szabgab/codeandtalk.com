    "description": "Are you into writing contributed modules, themes or distributions for Drupal 8? We'll look at the most important APIs you would use to integrate with and best practices to use so your project is fully multilingual-ready. Even if your project has nothing to do with multilingual per-say, making it possible to use your solution in a multilingual or even just foreign language scenario is a huge selling point.\n\nWe hosted several hands-on labs at prior DrupalCons to showcase the site building basics for Drupal 8 multilingual sites. It is now time to look at the backend pieces. While most APIs are designed to support multilingual by default and make sane assumptions about common scenarios, there are some important things to keep in mind for the best integration possible. Along with good practices we'll also discuss some limitations.",
