    "description": "What do the Weather Channel, the University of Oxford, and the Beatles have in common? Each use Drupal to run their websites — and each have a case study in the Featured Showcase on Drupal.org.\n\nIf you're intimidated by the thought of writing a case study for the Featured Showcase, don't be! Plenty of our Featured case studies aren’t from massive organizations. If you’ve considered writing a case study, either for your own internal use or for posting on Drupal.org, this session covers everything you need to know in order to write something great.\n\nAttendees who sit in on this session will walk away with knowledge about how to compose a Feature-worthy case study, and will also have an understanding of how they can get involved in the review process for case studies that aren’t their own. Common problems with submitted case studies will be covered, and attendees will learn about ways of constructing and editing case studies to avoid those pitfalls.\n\nSpecific topics covered will include:\n\nWhy case studies are important for your business and for the Drupal world\n\nWhat the Featured Showcase is and the value of getting your case studies there\n\nWhat takes a case study from “good” to “great\"\n\nWriting beyond the case study guidelines\n\nThe case study review and promotion process\n\nHow to get involved in the case studies issue queue\n\nThis is not a technical session. For attendees who are looking for ways to contribute to the Drupal community without touching code, or for people who want to write the best case study they possibly can, this session is for you.",
