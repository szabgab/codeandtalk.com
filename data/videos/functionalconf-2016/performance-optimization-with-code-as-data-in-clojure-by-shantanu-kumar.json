    "description": "Homoiconicity (code as data, data as code) is one of the hallmarks of Lisp. Clojure, a Lisp-1 language, has this wonderful feature too. In this talk I will discuss about performance optimization techniques that leverage homoiconicity.\n\nNo discussion on performance optimization can happen without discussing performance benchmarking. In this talk I will show how to do comparative benchmarking while trying to find performance bottlenecks. I will then proceed to showing techniques on using Clojure's homoiconicity to optimize performance. I will also show how to discover latency breakup of any Clojure code in a waterfall-chart model using homoiconicity.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2016/proposal/2939\n\nConference: http://functionalconf.com/",
