    "description": "APL will be 50 years old in November 2016 (50 years from 1966-11-27 15.53.58, to be exact), and it remains unsurpassed in manifesting Kenneth E. Iverson\u2019s five important characteristics of notation: \n\nease of expression\nsuggestivity\nsubordination of detail\neconomy\namenability to proof\nThese characteristics are demonstrated by working through 16 APL expressions. The material is approachable for beginners and yet thought-provoking for experts.\n\nOne of the 16 expressions is a fast computation of the partition function without use of the Hardy-Ramanujan (1918) results.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2016/proposal/2561\n\nConference: http://functionalconf.com/",
