    "description": "The JVM is a state-of-the-art, cross-platform virtual machine supported by the vast Java platform and ecosystem, but is cursed with an ancient and clumsy language that is slowly modernizing. Haskell is a state-of-the-art programming language with immature platform and tooling and no commercial development of its primary implementation. GHCVM's objective is to combine the best of both worlds and reap the benefits.\n\nIn this talk, I will share my journey of how I waded through the internals of GHC and got Haskell and Java to play nice with each other.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2016/proposal/2928/bringing-the-power-of-haskell-to-the-jvm\n\nConference details: http://functionalconf.com/",
