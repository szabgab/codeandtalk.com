This talk will cover our learnings from building this product \u2013 what we did well and what went wrong. We will discuss the joys and the challenges that come with using a functional language day-in and day-out.\n\nI want to share our journey, so the community can learn from our experiences and we can get feedback from the experts as well.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2016/proposal/3168\n\nConference: http://functionalconf.com/",
