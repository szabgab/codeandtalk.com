  "description": "With over 5 years in the practice of tango, I would like to use tango techniques to explain the nuances in communication between product team and dev team. It's not often straight forward or easy. \n\nTango is an extreme dance in coordination and non verbal communication where both dancers decide how fast or how slow they want to take it. It is also one of the few dances where pauses are encouraged and takes the form of regrouping. \n\nIt will be an experiential learning experience. I will be using tango moves to explain communication techniques and considerations. \n\n(Note: It's not a session to learn tango, but a session to learn communication through tango.)\n\nConference: http://2016.agileindia.org\nSlide and Other details: https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1806",
