    "description": "Hunting value through conversations. This is a skill that helps Product Owners when working with stakeholders, analysts and requirements engineers. Start with identifying your project partners, and use the 7 Product Dimensions (user, interface, activities, data, control, environment and quality attributes) to uncover correct requirements for your product. Understand how you can use it to focus on value, deliver value and optimise value.\n\nUnfortunately all too often, many Product Owners do much of their work alone. We want the participants to experience the power of the conversation structured to hunt value through a specifically designed dojo, and we want to create better awareness of good requirements engineering practices. This session is intended to help Product Owners and Business Analysts create better requirements and to help them have richer and more powerful conversations. The session is based on the work of Ellen Gottesdiener and Mary Gorman’s “Discover to Deliver” as well as the work of James Shore and Diana Larsen’s Agile Fluency Model.",
