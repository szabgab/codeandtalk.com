  "description": "Hike is a new kind of a messaging app that is changing the way people connect with one another and simplifying the way they interact with content and services on mobile. At 100 million users exchanging 40 billion messages/month (Jan\u201916), and growing each day, Hike is working at a scale that no other Indian internet company today is. The key to Hike\u2019s hyper growth has been its ability to continuously re-organize itself and build a self-learning culture, something they continue to evolve and better everyday. Driving autonomy, alignment to Hike\u2019s mission, imbibing the internal culture and values, were all fundamental to this continuous change. Hear Kavin Bharti Mittal, Founder and CEO, Hike Messenger share his story on how he is building a self-learning organization and the role Agile plays in it.",
