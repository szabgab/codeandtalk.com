  "description": "We were at the forefront of scaling Scrum and Agile. Past tense. This talk will explore lessons learnt, and how to increase the probability of success for your scaling efforts.\n\nTo be clear, this is a failure story. However, failure inevitably leads to learning. And I would very much like to share my learnings with the wider agile-community.\n\nThis talk is divided into the following sections:\n\nHow we implemented Large Scale Scrum and were proud of it\nWhat we tried that went well and you should try, too\nThings we tried that didn't work - but may work for you\nWhat we tried that failed - and you shouldn't try either\nGeneral advice on what to look for in scaling frameworks\n\nConference: http://2016.agileindia.org\nSlide and Other details: https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1741",
