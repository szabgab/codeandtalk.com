    "description": "Developers apply continuous integration practices for server-side projects, but are not consistent with this practice for Web and JavaScript projects. With the rise of Single Page Web Application style projects, doing continuous integration is even more necessary than before. In this workshop, we'll discuss software craftsmanship for Web/JavaScript projects, and gets hands-on with the tools needed to take a simple web project from ad-hoc builds to continuous integration.\n\nThis session covers the basics of setting up a Web & JavaScript project for Continuous Integration. The goal is to apply the same engineering practices as for projects coded in Java. Topics covered:\n\nBuild tool for JS: Grunt\nIntegrating JSHint\nAutomated testing setup\nHooking into a CI tool like Travis\nOther tools as part of a build process: Webpack, transpiliation\nThis is a hands-on workshop! Basic knowledge of these technologies is required to have a successful workshop experience:\n\n* Basic command line\n\n* Basic JavaScript knowledge\n\n* Basic Web and CSS knowledge\n\nAttendees will be required to have their own laptop with the ability to install software (node.js, specifically).",
