  "description": "Spotify model is widely known model for scaling agile to get to fast releases and to promote creativity and innovation. In this session, we discuss about how Spotify model has been adapted outside Spotify in a major organization wide transformation to agile.   The session begins with a brief overview about the Spotify model. Then we discuss about the case study of implementing Spotify model across three continents in an onshore-offshore model.\n\nSpotify model encourages team independence from outside forces to promote new ideas. It encourages a marketplace of ideas to float in the organization so that the best ideas can be generated from the bottom instead of the top. Any dependencies between teams are well known by public contracts.\n\nWe will discuss, how the team structure changed along with their responsibilities? How the change in the software team affected the organization?  How did leaders contribute value? Which changes were successful and what were not? What were the effects on software development team itself?\n\nPS: Participants can learn more about Spotify model at the link http://ucvox.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/113617905-scaling-agile-spotify-11.pdf\n\nConference: http://2016.agileindia.org\nSlide and Other details: https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/2192",
