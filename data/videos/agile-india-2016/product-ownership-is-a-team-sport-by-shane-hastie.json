    "description": "A number of agile brands downplay the need for business analysis and requirements management on agile projects, putting large store in the role of the Product Owner.  This paper tackles some of the problems this misconception can result in and shows how effective product ownership almost always requires a team with a variety of skills and backgrounds to be effective.\n\nProduct Ownership requires clarity of vision, alignment with organizational strategy, understanding of the development process and the ability to communicate with a wide variety of stakeholders across all levels both inside and outside the organization.  The complexity of the role is most often more than a single person can (or should) cope with â€“ effective product ownership requires a teamwork approach covering a variety of skills and knowledge.",
