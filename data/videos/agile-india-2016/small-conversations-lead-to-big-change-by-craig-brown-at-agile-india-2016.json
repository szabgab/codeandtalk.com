  "description": "It's great to come to conferences and hear all the good advice from lost of smart and experienced people.\n\nBut how likely are we to take our insights back and drive real change? What stops us from really changing the world?\n\nIt's a truism that an inpidual can't beat the system, right? So how do we go about making change a collective agenda? How do we encourage leadership everywhere? We start by focusing on others rather than ourselves.\n\nIn this interactive session I lead a series of small activities that model how we can go from a discussion with our friend about how things should be to leading change across the organisation. \n\nI run three small discussions. Each one is designed to teach a method for increasing influence and effecting organisational change.  We pick the theme of \"When I saw someone do something great/amazing at work\" and each iteration we increase the number of people in the discussion, and make the stories more personal.\n\nThis shows how in just three iterations of a discussion we can totally change the way we interact with the environment (i.e. the people in the wider business) and drive braver conversations.",
