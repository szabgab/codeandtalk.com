  "description": "In 1995, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber introduced Scrum, today the most popular Agile methodology, according to every Agile report. \n\n20 years later, that same collaboration, led by Scrum.org, produced Nexus, the proposal from the Scrum creators to Scale Scrum in large Software development initiatives that include hundreds of people. \n\nOver 45 minutes, we'll explore the Nexus framework, its artefacts and roles, as well as some practices, differences and similarities between Scrum and Nexus. The underlying philosophy will be displayed and discussed. \n\nWe'll also take a look at real organisations already using Nexus to scale their software development efforts using the Scaled Professional Scrum program from Scrum.org to transform their product development\n\nResources: Nexus is free and available for download on https://www.scrum.org/Portals/0/NexusGuide%20v1.1.pdf",
