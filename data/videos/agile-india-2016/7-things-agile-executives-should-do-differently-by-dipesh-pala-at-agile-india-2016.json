  "description": "One of the keys to a successful enterprise agile transformation is the support of Executive Leadership, which is more than simply providing approval. The Agile Executive enables, empowers and engages rather than controls.\n\nAccording to one recent survey, more than one in three organisations claim that the lack of Executive Leadership engagement within their businesses is plaguing current journey towards sustainable organisational Agility.\n\nWith a special focus on Executive teams, Dipesh will be drawing upon more than a decade of Agile transformation experiences across multiple organisations, and share real-life case studies and insights to illustrate the following key things that Agile Executives need to do differently:\n\nStop Starting, Start Finishing\nSlow Down to Go Faster\nOne Team, One Dream\nFoster Fully Capable Teams\nFail Early & Fail Small\nDeliver Business Value, not just Projects\nServant Leadership\nAwareness of the above principles is important and may sound simple; however turning the awareness of these elements into the inner workings of our daily routine takes discipline. With that in mind, all attendees will also be given \u2018The Agile Leaders Checklist' that will assist them in making such behaviours habitual.\n\nIf you are an Executive or a Leader of an Agile team, this session will provide clear implications for where to focus your efforts in order to unleash the full potential of Agile methods to gain a competitive edge. You will be inspired by knowing what serves to catalyze and nourish progress \u2013 and what does the opposite.",
