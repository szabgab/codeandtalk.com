    "description": "Agile adopts an empirical approach to software development. One of the key aspects of a successful Agile Implementation is how quickly we can react to change. For this, we need to ensure that data flows seamlessly from customer to the Agile team. This data should form a critical part of our decision making.\n\nIs the customer successful in using our product or service?\nWhich features are customer most interested in?\nWhere are the friction points in usage?\nWhere are the failures happening in our product?\nHow is the customer engaging with our product over time?\nand many more similar questions.\n\nIn this talk, I discuss best practices in data collection, analysis and visualization and how data can make your Agile process and thereby your business more effective.",
