    "description": "One of the risks agile organizations face is an over-reliance on a single omni-present and omni-potent Product Owner.  This critical reliance on a fallible Product Owner often results in a lack of clear direction on how and when to \"pivot\", with IT falling back on their bias, which is to build more and more features.\n\nIn this session, we will explore how lessons and ideas from the Lean Startup movement can be effectively combined with Agile delivery in a 5-step process to drive the right business outcomes. \n\nHolistic Discovery: Assessing key customers, problems & markets\nRisk-Driven Product Backlog: Challenging & testing your assumptions\nExploratory Sprints: Quick, cheap ways to validate your approach\nData-Driven Sprint Review: Using data to drive decisions\nValidating Product Increment: Analyzing & evolving your production system\nTools and techniques gleaned from the Lean Startup movement will be leveraged to support each of the activities outlined.",
