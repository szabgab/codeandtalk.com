  "description": "Agile has had an unbelievable impact on the way we develop software. But has it really improved the organisations adopting it? Both Nokia and Yahoo were the envy of the Agile community in the early 2000s. Neither of them have really taken over their respective market segments.\nThere are however a few very effective organisations, some of which have adopted Agile and some of which have not. They are from a diverse set of industries \u2013 nursing, tomato processing, banking and gaming, among others. And even though they are very different companies, you can discover patterns. In this session, we will discover what is needed beyond adopting Agile to not just survive, but to thrive in the 21st century.\n\nConference: http://2016.agileindia.org\nSlide and Other details: https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1676",
