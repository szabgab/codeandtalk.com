  "description": "How much does one story point cost? Is Sprint 0 an expense or an asset? Can you run Scrum with a fixed-cost contract? Agile challenges the existing approach to financial aspects of running projects: i.e. budgeting, forecasting, financial planning and vendor contracts.\n\nApplying new financial models becomes increasingly important for larger organisations adopting Agile. While they are going through an Agile transformation, they also need to maintain transparent financial governance and reporting.

No financial degree is required and all the content explained in plain English with plenty of pictures!",
