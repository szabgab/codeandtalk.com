  "description": "Over the past decade, eXtreme Programming practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) & Behaviour Driven Developer (BDD), Refactoring, Continuous Integration and Automation have fundamentally changed software development processes and inherently how engineers work. While TDD has seen a great adoption on server side, developers still find it hard to apply TDD for developing UI components.\n\nIn this hands-on, live coding demo, Naresh will build a web commenting and discussion feature (like Disqus) in React.js, 100% test driven. He will also demonstrate how TDD will help us drive an object-functional design to strike a pragmatic balance between the Object-Oriented and Functional Programming paradigms.",
