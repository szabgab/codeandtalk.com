    "description": "Seth Godin describes a tribe as \u2013 \"\u2026group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea.\" For millions of years, human beings have been part of one tribe or another. A group needs only two things to be a tribe: a shared interest and a way to communicate. And this is what a modern day business needs to survive and prosper in the long run \u2013 a growing tribe around a shared interest.\n \nIn his session, Vishal Khandelwal, the founder and chief tribesman of SafalNiveshak.com, will share his experience in building his tribe of 20,000+ readers across 135 countries in a span of just four years, even while he maintained a lean, clean, structure-less, and profitable model.\n \nSafalNiveshak.com is a website dedicated to helping small investors become smart, independent, and successful in their stock market investing.
