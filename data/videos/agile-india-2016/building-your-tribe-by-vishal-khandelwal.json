    "description": "Seth Godin describes a tribe as – \"…group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea.\" For millions of years, human beings have been part of one tribe or another. A group needs only two things to be a tribe: a shared interest and a way to communicate. And this is what a modern day business needs to survive and prosper in the long run – a growing tribe around a shared interest.\n \nIn his session, Vishal Khandelwal, the founder and chief tribesman of SafalNiveshak.com, will share his experience in building his tribe of 20,000+ readers across 135 countries in a span of just four years, even while he maintained a lean, clean, structure-less, and profitable model.\n \nSafalNiveshak.com is a website dedicated to helping small investors become smart, independent, and successful in their stock market investing. Vishal has 13+ years of experience as a stock market analyst and investor, and 4+ years as an investing coach. Safal Niveshak, which Vishal started in 2011, is now a community of 20,000+ dedicated readers, and was recently ranked among the best value investing blogs worldwide. Over the past four years, Vishal has trained over 2,000 individual investors in the art of investing sensibly, through his Workshops and online courses.",
