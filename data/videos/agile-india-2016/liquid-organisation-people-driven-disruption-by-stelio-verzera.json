  "description": "After a whole century of Tayloristic management of hierarchical and bureaucratic organisations, it's time to evolve farther.\nLet's learn how to have leadership and competences emerge, to let merit really count and be a compass for the entire group. Let's allow our ancient ability to behave as a unique organism to show its effectiveness in complexity, instead of trying to fit within mechanistic organisational rules. \nThe time has come for adaptive organisations to evolve how we perceive and live work. This is the time for liquid organisations to show how principles can be the only \"boss\" in the governance of human systems, decisions can be taken damn close to their application point, systemic learning can happen in fast and continuous iterations. This is what LiquidO is all about.\nAll this can be done. We have been doing it for years now. It works amazingly well. Come and see how.",
