  "description": "Do you find your work exciting and fulfilling? Is your team rewarded for finding better ways to work? While many organizations have adopted Agile approaches at a project level, few have effectively aligned their HR processes with Agile values, or made finding better ways of working a truly rewarding and exciting proposition for their teams. With a new generation of employees who are interested equally in purpose as in profit, it is imperative that we revisit schemes like the 3600 annual review, and recognize not only their limitations, but also the damage they cause to individual morale and team productivity.\nJoin Sanjiv to explore the subject of creating a holistic performance management system that not only adheres to Agile principles, but actively promotes individual drive and team innovation. Learn how delink merit pay from feedback, the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; and how to create a \u201cflow state\u201d on your agile teams to enhance performance and spark innovation.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1955/the-joy-of-agile-work-managing-performance-and-sparking-innovation\n\nConference: http://2016.agileindia.org",
