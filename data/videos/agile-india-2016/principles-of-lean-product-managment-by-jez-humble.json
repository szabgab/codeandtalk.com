  "description": "Traditionally, project management is the paradigm used to build digital products. In this talk, we'll start by examining why traditional project management is wholly unsuitable for product development. Jez will then present the principles used to build digital products successfully in the modern lean/agile paradigm. In this session you will find out how to apply impact mapping and hypothesis-driven development to take an experimental approach to product development. We will also explore how practices such as continuous delivery and A/B testing are used to create fast feedback loops to make data-based investment decisions.",
