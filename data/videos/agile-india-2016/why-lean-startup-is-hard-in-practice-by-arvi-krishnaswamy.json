    "description": "Over the last couple of years, I\u2019ve blogged about my lean startup experiments (a popular post that made page one of HN). I\u2019ve spoken at conferences about applying lean to building mobile apps. And, I was a mentor at Lean Startup Machine. Along the way, I\u2019ve applied lean at my last startup across ideas incubated using an internal Y-Combinator incubation format. I\u2019ve collaborated with other entrepreneurs as a part of a DHC lean peer group (who reviewed this post). And right now, I\u2019m running lean experiments at Intuit, a large software company. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that while lean startup has been a terrific step forward in how we think about what to build next, there\u2019s still many significant challenges involved in practice. This session is based on a popular blog post I'd made and is an attempt to surface some of the issues so that we can talk about them as a community, and we can learn from each other.",
