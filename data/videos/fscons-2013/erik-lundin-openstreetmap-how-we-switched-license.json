    "description": "OpenStreetMap -- how we switched license\n\nThis will be a brief summary of how OpenStreetMap, the free map who anyone can edit, changed license of the data. The project was founded in 2004 and the data was licensed under a Creative Commons license. However, after a few years it appeared that the chosen license wasn't very suitable for this kind of open data. A changed license would have to be approved by all contributors, and so the issue was debated for several years. The concrete work to switch license began in 2010, and was completed in September 2012.\n\nDownload video: http://videos.fscons.org/fscons/2013/c444_-_2013-11-10_1515_-_openstreetmap_how_we_switched_license_-_erik_lundin_-_59.ogv",
