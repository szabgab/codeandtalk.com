    "description": "How to write your own Go tool?\n\nGo tools are very powerful and yet simple to use. But how are Go tools created? In this talk I’m going to answer this question by showing the various Go parser family packages (go/token, go/scanner, go/parser, etc…) and how to use them to create your own Go tool from scratch.\n\n Fatih Arslan is a Software Engineer at @DigitalOcean. Gopher and Coffee geek, he is the author of vim-go and several popular Go packages. He has contributed to numerous open source projects, such as Go, Terraform, and HCL. Have a look at his open source projects on GitHub.",
