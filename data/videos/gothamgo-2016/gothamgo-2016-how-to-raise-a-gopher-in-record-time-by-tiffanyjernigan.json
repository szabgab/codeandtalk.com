    "description": "How to Raise a Gopher in Record Time\n\nAs an electrical engineer, both in college and at work, my exposure to software development was limited. I have been interested in software development, began learning on my own and then I got an opportunity to shift at work. The team I joined was writing code in Go and I had a lot to learn quite quickly. For those who are new to Go and learning the language, having the right resources, especially early on, can make all the difference. Without knowing where to find them, a lot of time can be spent searching. I want to share what helped me accelerate my learning, which is not over, by the way, and never will be.\n\nTiffany Jernigan is a software engineer currently consulting for Docker. She previously was at Intel Corporation as a cloud software engineer in the Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) group and is a graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology. After pursuing a career in electrical engineering, she decided to transition to software engineering. When Tiffany is not writing software, she is learning French, reading mystery novels, in the gym practicing gymnastics, or spending time with family and friends.",
