    "description": "Dissection of Gophers: The history and (possible) future of the Golang Community\n\nIn this talk we will start by exploring the Go community with statistics on rate of growth, language comparisons, and diversity. Many people say that technology today as a whole is not diverse, therefore of course you would expect a programming languageâ€™s diversity level would be low as well. We will explore the impact diversity has on innovation and creativity. Then looked at solutions other communities have proposed and take notes on what worked well for them and then see if we can implement similar solutions. Lastly we will talk about what Golang can do to become a more approachable, welcoming language as a whole. Let's scrutinize ourselves and see where we can make the most improvements to create a holistic message of inclusivity.\n\nCassandra Salisbury a core team member at GoBridge where she spearheads the partnerships and chapters initiative. She currently serves as the lead organizer (and MC) for GoSF, the largest Golang meetup in world, and organizes Gopherfest in San Francisco. Cassandra specializes in developer technologies and is the Head of Communications and Community as part of the founding team at Netlify.",
