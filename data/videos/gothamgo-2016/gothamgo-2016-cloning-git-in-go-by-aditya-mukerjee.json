    "description": "Cloning Git in Go\n\nGitgo began as an experiment: how would programming today be different if Git had been written in Go instead of C?\n\nThe result: an implementation of Git that is compatible with existing Git repositories, but simpler, more portable, and fast enough to be used as a general-purpose data store. With Gitgo, Git is no longer just for managing source control. Go makes Git a practical choice for content distribution, distributed build systems, establishing consensus, and more. \n\nAditya Mukerjee is an engineer at Stripe on the Risk team, based in New York City. He studied statistics at Columbia and computer science at Cornell, and has been writing Go professionally for the past four years. When not defending users against online fraudsters, he spends his free time playing German-style board games and listening to embarrassing music.",
