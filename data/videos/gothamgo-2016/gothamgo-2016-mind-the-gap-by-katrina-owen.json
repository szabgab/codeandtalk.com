    "description": "Mind the Gap\n\nHow do you learn Go? First do the tour. Then read the language spec. Then write a lot of code. This works for a lot of people, but for some the gap between the tour and the spec is a vast chasm.\n\nIn his GopherCon 2015 keynote, Russ Cox said: “Go needs everyone’s help, and everyone isn’t here.”\n\nThis talk draws on two years of iterative exploration. It examines three ways to bridge this gap, aiming to make Go accessible to a broader audience.\n\n Katrina Owen is an open source advocate at GitHub.
