    "description": "To Go or Not to Go?\n\nWe often hear repeated themes about why engineers and companies like Go: static binaries, cross-compilation, fast build times, concurrency, great community, etc. As a gopher, it\u2019s easy to keep \u201cdrinking our own Kool-Aid,\u201d but for a small team building an initial prototype, is the switch worth it? Does it make sense to jump aboard the Go ship when nobody on the team has past experience in Go?\n\nUsing the right tool for a job means being able and willing to recognize that the right tool may be different for different people. This talk takes a step back and critically considers when to use Go\u2026 and when gasp another language or framework might be a better choice.\n\nPeggy Li is a software engineer on the Infrastructure team at Clever, which builds a platform that connects K-12 students and teachers to educational software. She previously worked on deployment tooling at LinkedIn and graduated from Duke with a double major in Computer Science and Economics. Outside of work, she enthusiastically participates in Women Who Go events and takes blurry photos of her plush gophers.",
