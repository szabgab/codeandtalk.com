But now you have many: roll-your-own EC2, Heroku, RDS, OpenShift, Google Cloud, Cloud Foundry, even Joyent.

In an hour, you will learn:\n\nThe difference between SaaS and PGaaS\nFeatures available on each platform\nEstimating and comparing pricing\nPerformance comparisons using synthetic benchmarks\n\nI will also cover some general notes on setting up databases in the cloud, as well as cautions for those new to cloud platforms. If you are planning to run Postgres or other databases on cloud hosting, you want to be at this talk.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nJosh Berkus is on the PostgreSQL Core Team and is CEO of PostgreSQL Experts, Inc., where he consults on availability architectures, performance, and data warehousing.
