If you think of a database as only a place to store your data, then perhaps it does not really matter what the internals of that database are; all you really need is a home for your data to be managed, nothing more.\n\nIf you think of a database as a place where you develop applications, then your expectations of your database software change. No longer do you only need data management capabilities, but you require processing functions, the ability to load in additional libraries, interface with other databases, and perhaps even additional language support.\n\nIf your database is just for storage, there are plenty of options. If your database is your development framework, you need Postgres.\n\nWhy? Well, letâ€™s get philosophical.\n\n\nAbout the Speaker\nr0ml is an amateur philosopher and juggler -- and a software professional. He would be a professional philosopher or juggler if he could, but data-driven philosophy is harder than data-driven programming, and juggling requires more precision and a lower tolerance for error than software -- so it's just easier to be a programmer. He prefers juggling clubs over balls and rings, and favors semasiology and epistemology over other branches of philosophy. He is also a Distinguished Engineer of the ACM.",
