We\u2019ve grown up with Postgres from our early 7.x series single database setup, to our current mix of 9.1+ installed across over 100 dedicated Postgres servers in 4 datacenters. Postgres\u2019 flexibility and sheer resilience to whatever we throw at it has served us well. This means:\n\n* 2 core-site datacenters with Postgres infrastructure tested to be capable of handling well over 1,100,000 database queries per minute.\n* Replication between those data centers running in a master-slave model with a scheduled role-reversal every 3 months.\n* Distinct core-site SLA\u2019s for read only availability, and read write availability. No scheduled outages; less than 30 minutes per year of scheduled read only time.\n* 3 different flavors of replications with at least 5-6 distinct types of replication topologies.\n* 3 distinct development environments for engineers complete with full database snapshots that refresh from production every week.\n* Varying different workloads including:\n* Servers with 768GB of RAM so everything fits in memory.\n* Multi terabyte databases where only 5% can fit in RAM.\n* A sharded core site (not warehouse!) table with over 2,600,000,000 tuples.\n* Real time main site anomaly detection database that ingests 87,000 tuples per second.\n* All of this is maintained by a a team of 1 person full time and 4 people part time.\n\nThis talk will be a look at how Postgres can form the backbone of a site at the scale of 315 million unique visitors a month.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nMatt Kelly has been working with TripAdvisor for the past 3.5 years, starting as a general software engineer. Last year he switched over to the operations team to be the person focused on advancing the Postgres infrastructure at TripAdvisor.",
