    "description": "Check out http://www.pgconf.us/2015/event/69/ for the full talk details.\n\nColumn oriented data stores bring notable performance advantages for analytic workloads; and they have gained popularity as part of proprietary database solutions in the past few years.\n\ncstore_fdw is an open source columnar store for PostgreSQL. The extension follows the same data layout as Facebook's Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) format, and brings the following benefits:\n\n* Compression: Reduces the on-disk data size by 2-4x\n* Column Projections: Only read column data relevant to query, improves the performance for I/O bound queries\n* Skip Indexes: Keeps min/max statistics for row groups and uses them to skip over unrelated rows.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nOzgun is a co-founder and the CTO at Citus Data. Prior to Citus, Ozgun worked as a software developer for four years in the Distributed Systems Engineering team at Amazon. There, he proposed, designed, and implemented novel algorithms on distributed caching and consistency; and also worked on building systems for scalable data analytics. Ozgun earned his M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, and his B.S. from Galatasaray University. He also holds patents on distributed cache consistency and load balancing.",
