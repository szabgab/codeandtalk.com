    "description": "Check out http://www.pgconf.us/2015/event/112/ for the full talk details.\n\nVitesse DB is PostgreSQL for data warehouse. Rapid advances in memory, SSD, and core-count have produced affordable, powerful computers that comfortably fit the working sets of most DW queries on a single machine without resorting to MPP. Unfortunately, processing speed and single-threaded limitations have precluded PostgreSQL from DW applications. \n\nIn this talk, we will describe how we made TPCH Q1 run more than 100X faster on a Postgres instance. In particular, how we dramatically increase per-core efficiency of the Executor using LLVM for dynamic query compilation, and how we thread and scale query execution across many cores efficiently, yet still maintain 100% compatibility with PostgreSQL.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nI am Founder at Vitesse Data. Prior to that, I worked at Elance-oDesk as Director of Data Services, and at Greenplum as Sr. Architect. Experienced in data systems, and in particular, MPP data warehouse systems dating back to Informix XPS.",
