Since we eat our own dogfood and spend a lot of time monitoring Postgres, I will cover in detail the metrics we care about and illustrate them with detailed data from real performance issues.\n\nThis talk is a tutorial that should appeal to the Postgres neophyte and the experienced practitioner alike.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nAs one of the founders of Datadog, Alexis spends a lot of time thinking about how to make monitoring work for engineering and ops teams. Prior to founding Datadog, Alexis Lê-Quôc served as the Director of Operations for Wireless Generation where he built the team and infrastructure that served millions of K-12 students across the country. He has presented sessions on cloud monitoring and server performance at conferences including DevOpsDays, Surge, Velocity, PyCon.",
