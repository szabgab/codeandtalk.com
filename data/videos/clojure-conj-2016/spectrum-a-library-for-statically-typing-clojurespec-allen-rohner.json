    "description": "Introducing Spectrum (github.com/arohner/spectrum), a static “typing” library that statically checks clojure code using standard clojure.spec annotations. While still early, spectrum is theoretically sound and can type-check itself. In this talk we’ll cover how spectrum is implemented and why you’d want to do such a thing. We’ll discuss the tradeoffs of static typing vs. clojure.spec in a pragmatic, dogma-free environment.",
