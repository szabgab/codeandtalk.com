    "description": "Declarative programming has been the style of choice for implementing countless creative applications, from “Zork” to Harold Cohen’s “AARON.” We’ll explore why it helps to reason about machine creativity in this way and use Clojure’s Overtone toolkit and clojure.spec to illustrate abstract concerns and domain intelligence. The content of this talk will be based on my successes and missteps  building art installations and writing software concerned with aesthetics and narrative.",
