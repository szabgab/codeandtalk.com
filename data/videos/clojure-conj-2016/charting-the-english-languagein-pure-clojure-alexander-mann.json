  "description": "In 2008, Collobert and Weston analyzed 2500 english words using deep neural nets. Since then, people like Joseph Turian have used technology such as t-SNE to visualize these results in a way that humans can actually comprehend (2 dimensions instead of thousands). This talk explores a naive Clojure programmer\u2019s attempt to reproduce Turian\u2019s word map of Collobert and Weston\u2019s word feature vectors in pure Clojure from the raw sentences data set. Attendees will walk away with the contextual understanding and basic toolset to reproduce this study.",
