    "description": "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but there\u2019s a secret going around that will probably startle and shock software developers the world over.\n\nCode isn\u2019t the most crucial part of your project.\n\nAt its best, open source serves to empower the recipients of its brilliance through technological innovation. At its core, open source is a jumble of information created by people to be used by other people, like any other transactional relationship before it.\n\nYet open source is viewed as being a \u201cmembers only\u201c club for those who speak its language.\n\nThat\u2018s dumb and I\u2019m here to throw that old ideology out in favor of inviting a more realistic one: open source is for everyone.\n\nAt Hoodie, we recognize that the best open source projects hold strong values like diversity, empowerment and decentralisation. So it only makes sense for an entire project to be built by an amazing and dedicated community consisting of developers and non-coding experts. We began doing this last year by holding an open call for editorial contributors to join the team. The response was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nPeople have been waiting for an opportunity to join your open source communities, but first you have to prepare the way. I\u2019ll be sharing the lessons learned from Hoodie venturing into the exploration of inviting non-coding experts to join forces and how the results of this experience have brought us closer to modern open source, beyond software.",
