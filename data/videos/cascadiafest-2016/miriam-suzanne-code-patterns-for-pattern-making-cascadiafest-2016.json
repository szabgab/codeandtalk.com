    "description": "Style Guides and Pattern Libraries are great tools for documenting the relationships between code and design, but beautiful docs and consistent UI are only half the battle. Somewhere, behind the scenes, those patterns have to live in our code, and hopefully make life easier for developers. We can go beyond \u201cliving\u201d style guides to find tools that encourage and document pattern-making from the ground up, across projects, without adding developer overhead. From Sass maps and template macros, to front-end architecture and style-guide generators \u2014 let's talk about the code patterns that make our UI patterns possible.",
