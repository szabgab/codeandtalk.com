    "description": "Photography is all about understanding and working within a wide variety of constraints. Mechanical and electrical systems interact to create limitations for photographers. Yet these constraints have led to endless creativity.\n\nAPI design is a lot like photography. There are often dozens of interrelated constraints that API designers must adhere to, which can seem daunting at first. But like photography, understanding and embracing these constraints leads to great design.\n\nThis talk will teach you how to find your API's “voice”, the underlying philosophy that makes an API consistent and easy to use, all viewed through the lens of photography.",
