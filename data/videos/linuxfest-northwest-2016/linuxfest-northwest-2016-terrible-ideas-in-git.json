  "description": "Adapted from his class \"The Screaming Horrors of Git,\" Corey takes us on a magical tour through the (mis)use of Git to do things its creators never intended. In this humorously delivered exploration of one of the open source community's more ubiquitous tools, Corey demonstrates that a finely crafted wrench makes a barely acceptable hammer if you hold it wrong.\n\nGiven that most modern toolsets are backstopped by git repositories (or, if you're unfortunate, Subversion), git is increasingly central to DevOps tooling and design patterns. This talk covers a variety of common antipatterns commonly seen in git workflows, as well as advice on how to best avoid them, delivered in a humorous manner.\n\nA (brief) selection of third party open-source tools for working with Git more effectively will also be showcased.",
