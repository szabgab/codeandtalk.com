  "description": "Pump.io is a promising project to create a federated social network. It was abandoned for a while, but its maintainer has recently started transferring governance and code maintenance to the community. Come to this talk to learn details about what Pump.io is, why it's awesome, and the future plans for it.\n\nNote that this was formerly a lightning talk dealing mostly with the community, but has since expanded to a full session. We'll use the extra time to talk a little about the history of where Pump.io comes from and its API. The latter is also why this session is \"intermediate\", instead of the original \"beginner\".\n\nAlex Jordan is a core developer of the Pump.io reference implementation. No prior knowledge necessary.",
