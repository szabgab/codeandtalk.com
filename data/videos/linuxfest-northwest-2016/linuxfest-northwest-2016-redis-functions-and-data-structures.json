  "description": "Dave Nielsen\nRedis is the fastest database. What? Really? Yep! Why? When your apps need interactive data or your operational systems need a boost, there is no faster database than Redis. This is part of the reason Redis is one of the fastest growing databases and the most popular database deployed in containers. In this talk, Dave Nielsen, Developer Advocate at Redis Labs, will share the functions and data structures used by Redis developers to solve common scalability challenges facing web scale companies. As part of this talk, Dave will demo the code used to implement Redis for many common use cases. You can learn more about open source Redis at http://redis.io and http://redislabs.com/ebook",
