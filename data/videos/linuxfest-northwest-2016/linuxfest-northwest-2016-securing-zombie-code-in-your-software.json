    "description": "Zombie code, or software that is outdated and contains vulnerable versions of certain components, can live in your code forever if you\u2019re not aware of it.  The acceleration of modern development lifecycles and the breakdown of an undocumented software supply chain have opened up new pathways for zombies to enter your software - leaving you exposed to security threats.  Jeff will discuss best practices for implementing an Open Source Software management strategy to detect, track and eliminate the risks associated with Zombie code, so you can continue using/re-using open source safely and effectively.",
