  "description": "As an electrical engineer, both in college and at Intel, my exposure to software development was limited. I have been interested in software development, began learning on my own and then I got an opportunity to shift inside Intel. The team I joined was writing code in Go and I had a lot to learn quite quickly. For those who are new to Go and learning the language, having the right resources, especially early on, can make all the difference. I want to share what helped me accelerate my learning, which is not over, by the way, and never will be.",
