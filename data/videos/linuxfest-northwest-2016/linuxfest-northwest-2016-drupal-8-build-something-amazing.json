    "description": "Drupal 8 has been released into the wild. I wish to give both a high level overview of what Drupal 8 brings to the table as well as discuss some of the exciting lower-level improvements. Attendees can expect to leave with a broader understanding of Drupal 8 and know where to go to find out more information.\n\nProposed Outline:\n\nDrupal in a nutshell \nGoodness - there is a lot of new stuff in the Drupal we know\nAPI friendly & RESTFUL integrations\nCKeditor and Views now shipping out of the box and what that means for instant productivity\nEnhanced accessibility to further the web for everyone\nProper deployment mechanisms with configuration management\nThe new Drupal - don't be afraid\nA new theme layer built upon Twig\nComposer for keeping dependencies under control\nSymfony\nBigPipe - ready to rock and roll\nContrib\nA brief overview of what is ready for Drupal 8\nMoving forward with Drupal 8\nI realize that is a lot to cover in 45 minutes. The idea is to give an on the ground perspective on where Drupal 8 is at and how folks can start to use it for their projects now. I hope to showcase a few examples of the work being done by the community.\n\nAs much as I can I hope to share experiences of the Bellingham Drupal community working with Drupal 8 in our monthly meetups and I have a few real world use cases where WWU has done a lot of work with Drupal 7 that will be greatly simplified by migrating to Drupal 8.",
