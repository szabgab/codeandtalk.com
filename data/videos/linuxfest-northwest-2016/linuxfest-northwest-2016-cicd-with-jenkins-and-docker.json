    "description": "This talk will be a brief introduction to the possibilities with using Jenkins and Docker containers in your CI/CD workflow. I will demonstrate how to quickly and automatically build, test and deploy software. There will be an overview of what CI/CD actually is as well as explaining each technology: Git, Jenkins, and Docker. Time permitting, I should have a working demo at the small scale of how this can be implemented.\n\nAttendees should expect to come away with a base knowledge of the components of this system as well as how they integrate together. Hopefully if they are not using something similar they can become inspired to try and set this up with their own projects!",
