  "description": "When you mention Devils and Penguins \u2014 the mascots for both BSD and Linux, respectively \u2014 the first thing that might immediately come to mind is an NHL hockey game between New Jersey (the Devils) and Pittsburgh (the Penguins). But we\u2019re not going there with this presentation because, for starters, it\u2019s not a competition.\n\nMost Free/Open Source Software users run Linux as their operating system of choice, choosing one (or more) of the 300 or so distros currently active on DistroWatch. Not as many have crossed the street, rhetorically speaking, and taken a look at the other Open Source operating system, BSD and its many variants.\n\nAs a long time and current Linux user new to PC-BSD \u2014 essentially the BSD equivalent to Linux Mint \u2014 my intention is to:\n\n\u00b7        Outline the (many) similarities and (few) differences between Linux and BSD,\n\n\u00b7        Walk the audience through the process of moving from Linux to BSD, unless the audience is in a hurry, then I\u2019ll run them through it,\n\n\u00b7        Describe the ease-of-use and pitfalls of day-to-day use of PC-BSD for the average user, and\n\n\u00b7        How to pitch in and make code and other contributions (e.g., documentation, translation) to BSD variants, even while doing the same for Linux distributions,\n\n\u00b7        And more!\n\nThis talk is more of an overview rather than instructional, though resources will be made available regarding where to download BSD variants and fundamental instructions on how to install it.",
