    "description": "You’ve heard about Python’s GIL, its \"Global Interpreter Lock\". But what is it really? What does it do, both good and bad?\n\nCome learn all about the Python GIL. You’ll learn about its history, all the problems it solves, all the problems it causes (that we know about!), and what it would take to remove the GIL.\n\nAttendees should be familiar with computer programming, should know some Python, and should be comfortable with a little C code in the slides.",
