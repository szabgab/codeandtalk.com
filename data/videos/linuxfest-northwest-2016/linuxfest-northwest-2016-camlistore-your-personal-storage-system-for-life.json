  "description": "Camlistore is your personal storage system for life.\n\nCamlistore is a set of open source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data in the post-PC era. Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.\n\nhttp://camlistore.org\nIn this session, we will first present Camlistore's philosophy, architecture, as well as parts of its implementation (most of it written in Go), punctuated with live demos. We will follow with an informal tutorial, starting with a standard setup to let interested people try Camlistore (on their own machine or on the cloud), and moving forward to a few different use cases.",
