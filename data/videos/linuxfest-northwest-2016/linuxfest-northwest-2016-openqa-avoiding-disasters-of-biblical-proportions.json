    "description": "What do we mean, biblical? 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanos, human sacrifice, mass hysteria, dogs and cats living together... and on that note, this talk is presented by Adam Williamson, QA Community Manager at Red Hat, and Richard Brown, QA Technical Lead at SUSE.\n\nopenQA is an automated testing tool, capable of full system, console, and graphical application testing. This session will give an introduction to openQA's capabilities, share how it is used by both openSUSE and Fedora for the testing of their distributions, and suggest ideas to attendees as how it could be used for testing their software, operating systems, or virtual machine images.",
