  "description": "\"Open source\" split from \"free software\" to be more pragmatic, to gain\nentry to the business world, partly by being more accepting of\nproprietary software. This led to descriptions of free software as\n\"vegan\" and open source as \"vegetarian.\" Let's question this analogy,\nand in the process explore how the Tofurky is made, looking at\nunderlying motivations, ethics, communication, and collaboration.\n\nWe don't just want to write free software or open source code. We want\nothers to understand *why* we do it. We want to get along with each\nother. We want other people to join us in envisioning a world where\nour kind of collaborative production is the norm. At the very least,\nwe want them to think we're not crazy.\n\nThe challenges for those committed to our cause can be similar to\nthose choosing to be vegetarians or vegans -- having to explain why we\nwon't eat what seems to others to be perfectly good software/food, why\nwe can only frequent certain restaurants/websites, why we refuse to\nserve meat/proprietary software to others. We can be similarly accused\nof being judgmental, impractical, idealistic, or \"in a phase.\"\n\nBecause many more people are familiar with the concept of dietary\nrestrictions motivated by concern for animal rights, environmental\nethics, sustainability, and health, this can be fertile ground for\nanalogies to explain our choices in software and technology.\n\nBut does this analogy also hold up when talking about historical\ndifferences between the \"open source\" and \"free software\" camps? Is it\na useful way to understand those perspectives?\n\nDrawing on literature from ethics, dietary practices, distributive\njustice, and the philosophy of technology, I'll disassemble the\nanalogy into its ingredients and explore several variations.\n\nAs we chew the fat, we'll learn more about the diverse motivations\nwithin our movement, leading to both better collaborative potential\namong current practitioners and improved recipes for communicating\nabout what we do to brand new audiences.\n\nThe takeaway for the audience will be a deeper understanding of the\ndiversity of motivations that people have for writing and sharing free\nsoftware and open source, a toolkit of analogies and metaphors with\nwhich to explain what we do to others less familiar in their\nworkplaces and personal lives, and an improved grasp of how to\ncommunicate across different ethical perspectives.",
