    "description": "Whether your title is Production Engineering, DevOps, SRE, or IT doesn't matter. You're the lifeblood of the company, the team that invisibly makes everything work. You, my friend, carry the pager.\n\nJoin Bri as he passes on wisdom, wit, and embarrassing stories, replacing his normal code-filled presentations with humour and humiliation. You'll learn how to run a solid yet nimble production infrastructure, organize your workload, avoid burnout, and automate caffeine ingestion.\n\nYou may you end up making the same mistakes he's made, but at least you'll make them your own.",
