  "description": "This talk will be going over the fundamental differences in how Puppylinux is different than most normal distributions and how that can be advantageous for novices and experienced linux users alike. I will be going over the use of a layered file system, system save files (saving every change you make in a single file), running your entire OS from RAM, and other various benefits that Puppylinux gives users. While this talk will share similar material to my 2014 and 2015 talks at Southeast Linuxfest, it will be presented in an entire new manner.",
