  "description": "Corey Quinn\nDocker (and by extension, microservices based architecture) has expanded our horizons with respect to how the industry builds and supports applications at scale, which helps to explain why so many people seem willing to throw away decades of experience in favor of untested tools and barely functional design principles.\n\nIn this entertaining and somewhat irreverent talk, Corey presents the \"other side\" of the containerization craze: how configuration management fits into a world consumed by the DockerDockerDocker madness, how \"containers all the way down\" can blow up in your face when you least expect it, and how promising technologies should perhaps be vetted a bit more thoroughly before you try to run a hospital on top of them.",
