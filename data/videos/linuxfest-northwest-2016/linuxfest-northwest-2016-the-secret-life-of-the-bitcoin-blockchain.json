  "description": "Is the Future of Cryptocurrency Heading for a Global Solidarity Economy or a Decentralized Den of Inequity?\n\nNow that Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain has been running for over 7 years, let\u2019s check our roadmap for saving the world with this thing. What problems are we actually solving with it? Come learn about its evolving revolutionary potential, and some new problems we might be creating with it along the way.\n\nWe\u2019ll look beyond bullshit fantasies of techno-utopian escape and talk about the nature of the technology itself. There\u2019s so much more to it than an unspeakably bleak future of blockchain-flavored bank widgets. Let\u2019s get real about where development is headed and take a critical look at whether subversive innovation is actually leading to an overall positive impact on society.",
