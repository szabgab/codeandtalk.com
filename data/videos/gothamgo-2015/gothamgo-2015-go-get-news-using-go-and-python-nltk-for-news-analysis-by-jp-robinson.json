    "description": "GothamGo 2015: go get -news (Using Go and Python NLTK for news analysis) by JP Robinson\n\nNewshound, a breaking news aggregator JP developed as a side project at The New York Times, recently switched most of itâ€™s back end over to Go from Python. The tool uses email, HTML and text processing to analyze email alerts from major news organizations and provides various insights into the data. The talk will briefly introduce the tool and then walk through the various Go packages and techniques used to complete the recent rewrite.\n\nJP is a principal engineer at The New York Times working in the cross platform services and games groups where he has been using Go to improve systems for over 2 years. In his spare time, JP enjoys fat cats, food and photography.\n\nSee http://localhost:3000/program#jp_robinson\n\nThis is a replacement (with better audio) of this earlier upload:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6hx4yEbWNs",
