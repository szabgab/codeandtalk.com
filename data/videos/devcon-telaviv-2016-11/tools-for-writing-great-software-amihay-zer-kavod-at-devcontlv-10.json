    "description": "This talk describes the principles, approaches, and techniques I collected over the years of writing software. This is by no means a complete list of “how-tos”, nor do I believe such a list can exist. These are the techniques I find most useful when I architect, design or write software.\n\nI hope that you might find them useful the next time you write a piece of software. Consider this as an alternative to doing it the old fashion way of making the mistakes yourselves ;)",
