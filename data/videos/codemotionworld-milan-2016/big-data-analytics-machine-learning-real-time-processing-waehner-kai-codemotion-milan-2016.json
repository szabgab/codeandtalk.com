    "description": "The world gets connected more and more every year due to Mobile, Cloud and Internet of Things. \"Big Data\" is currently a big hype. Large amounts of historical data are stored in Hadoop to find patterns, e.g. for predictive maintenance or cross-selling. But how to increase revenue or reduce risks in new transactions? \"Fast Data\" via stream processing is the solution to embed patterns into future actions in real-time.
