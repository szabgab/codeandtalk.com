    "description": "Alan Turing was the most talented potential super coder. What happened to him is a tragic tale. He was victimized and marginalized despite proving himself by breaking the Enigma code. Sadly, such instances continue to happen so coders are not able to code. Code in motion is a concept I'd like to define as code which is useful to the final consumer. Otherwise code is a hindrance. I will share 3 corporate examples, propose solutions to develop business vision along with coding and conclude by appealing to coders present to give the “code in motion” a higher priority compared to coding in itself.",
