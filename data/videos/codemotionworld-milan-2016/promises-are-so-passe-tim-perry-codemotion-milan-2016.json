    "description": "Promises saved JavaScript from callback hell, but we\u2019re not out of the woods yet. Anybody who\u2019s written heavily asynchronous code knows there\u2019s still pain in the promise\u2019d land, from the flood of extra ceremony required to the frustratingly fractured function scope. Fortunately, this isn\u2019t the end of the line, and with generators and JavaScript's upcoming async/await syntax we can do even better. In this talk we\u2019ll look at where asynchronous development is going next, how it\u2019s going solve your problems, and what you need to do to put it into practice today.",
