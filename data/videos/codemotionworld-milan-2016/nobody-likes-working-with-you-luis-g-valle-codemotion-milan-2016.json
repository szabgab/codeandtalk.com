    "description": "It doesn't matter how efficient your code is, if your team mates don't like working with you, you are a bad software developer. Most of your time is spent communicating with others (emails, tasks, comments on pull requests) If you can't do it properly your colleagues won't take your opinions into consideration or will be afraid to ask for them. And a team unable to communicate and speak openly will end up producing bad code. \u00e2\u20ac\u2039 In this presentation I will talk about how to: - Give constructive feedback - Comment on others code nicely - Disagree without offending - Express your ideas.",
