    "description": "Sometimes a developer faces the question or even a tough choice — should I become a teamleader or a manager? I cannot answer this question for anyone, but I can tell others what experience I had. I’ve met two types of teamleaders in the industry — one that is more an architect and doesn’t manage estimates or prioritisation, but is just responsible for the architecture and the code quality; and the second one that does both management and architecture. The latter one is the most interesting one, and is the topic of the talk.",
