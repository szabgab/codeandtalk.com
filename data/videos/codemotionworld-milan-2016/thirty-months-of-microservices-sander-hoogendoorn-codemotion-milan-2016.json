    "description": "Microservices are the next hype. Websites are full of introducing posts, books are being written and conferences organized. There\u2019s big promises of scalability and flexibility. However, when you are knee deep in mud as an architect, developer or tester, it\u2019s hard to find out how to get there. Sander Hoogendoorn, independent craftsman and CTO of Klaverblad Insurances, discusses the long and winding road his projects, greenfield and brownfield, have travelled. Sander will e.g. address polyglot persistence, DDD, bounded contexts, modeling HTTP/REST, continuous delivery and many lessons learned.",
