    "description": "Animation is captivating. Our brains are trained to respond most intently to movement. For this reason, animation in a user experience is extremely important, and also very easy to overdo. Carefully considered animation can compose spatial maps to guide users. Animations can be responsive, resolution-independent, and make a site function intuitively.\nIn this session Sarah will cover a myriad of use cases, from both design and technical implementation standpoints.\n\nSarah is an award-winning Manager of UX Design and Engineering at Trulia (Zillow) and staff writer at CSS-Tricks.\nShe’s given a Frontend Masters workshop on Advanced SVG Animations, and is working for a book for O’Reilly on SVG Animations. \nFor 15 years she worked as a web developer and designer and at points as a Scientific Illustrator, an Undergraduate Professor and has tutored a Byzantine Icon painter in Santorini.\nSarah loves SVG, informative animation, and welding together pieces of the DOM.\n\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 24 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.cssconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
