    "description": "HTTP/2 has rightfully garnered a lot of interest from the web performance community. For better or worse, the story of HTTP/2 has become tied to notions of free performance and how it will make \"everything we know about web performance wrong\".\nThe reality of HTTP/2 can sometimes be sobering. My talk will aim to highlight some rarely talked about caveats, in the hopes of bringing some balance to the HTTP/2 discussion.\n\nMichael is a performance engineer at 99designs focusing primarily on frontend architecture, tooling, and site performance.\nAn advocate for open source software he's currently the project lead for Node Sass and a core contributor to LibSass.\nHe's also heavily involved in the local developer community as part of the CSSConf AU and the MelbCSS meetup organising teams.\n\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 24 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.cssconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
