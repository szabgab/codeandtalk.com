    "description": "This talk takes a look at the approaches and learnings from a first-time experience of developing a system entirely around micro-services. This project had many challenges, including a distributed team, many of whom were working together for the first time, an aggressive deadline and a rapidly changing business model. This talk will explore how micro-services can assist in such a challenging environment, and examine the tools chosen and the processes used to deliver a successful software project.\"\n\nAbout the speaker: \"Rory is a former start-up co-founder and DevOps evangelist with a passion for high scalability, RESTful architecture, NoSQL solutions and cloud-based services.\nRory\u2019s overriding mission in his professional life is to erase the traditional dividing line between Development and Operations in software companies. He strives to help create environments where cross-disciplinary teams are singularly focused on bringing maximum value to customers. And he sometimes sings opera.\"",
