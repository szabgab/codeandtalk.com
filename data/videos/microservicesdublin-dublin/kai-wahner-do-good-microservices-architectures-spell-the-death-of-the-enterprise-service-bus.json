    "description": "Microservices are the next step after SOA: Services implement a limited set of functions. Services are developed, deployed and scaled independently. \nContinuous Integration and Continuous Delivery control deployments. This way you get shorter time to results and increased flexibility. Microservices have to be independent regarding build, deployment, data management and business domains. A solid Microservices design requires single responsibility, loose coupling and a decentralized architecture. A Microservice can to be closed or open to partners and public via APIs. This session discusses the requirements, best practices and challenges for creating a good Microservices architecture, and if this spells the end of the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). A live demo will show how middleware and Microservices complement each other using containers, continuous integration, REST services, and open source frameworks such as Cloud Foundry.",
