    "description": "Did you know that there\u2019s an experimental Web Bluetooth API under development in Chrome? Let\u2019s explore this brave new world of hardware-accessing offline-accessible web apps together by building a fully functional mobile bike computer. We\u2019ll talk about the BLE protocol and use Web Bluetooth to connect to Bluetooth Smart sensors providing real-time heart rate, speed, and pedaling cadence metrics. Then, we\u2019ll dive into Functional Reactive Programming using the cycle.js library to represent and transform sensor data as observable streams. It\u2019s going to be a wild ride, though be warned: there will be some wheely bad bike puns.",
