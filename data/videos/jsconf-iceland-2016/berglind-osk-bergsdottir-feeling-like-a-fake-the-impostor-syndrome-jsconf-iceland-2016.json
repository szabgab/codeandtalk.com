    "description": "Have you ever felt like a fraud and the whole world is going to find out that you're really not as competent as other people think? Do you feel like your success is because of luck or timing but not your own skills? Then you are not alone! This concept is well known and is called the Impostor Syndrome. It's not limited to software development but it's very common in our field.\n\nMost people have experienced this at some point in their lives but don't talk about since they think they're alone. In this talk I'm gonna tell my story of suffering from the Impostor Syndrome and share my advice on how to overcome it.",
