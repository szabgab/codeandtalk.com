    "description": "This talk is about flow, a static type-checker for JavaScript which is developed and maintained by Facebook. We have been using flow extensively at QuizUp for half a year now and it's been a great success in a big JS codebase. In this talk I will answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is it?\nWhy use it?\nWhat can it do?\nWhat can't it do?\nLastly I will go over lessons learned and our experience with using flow.",
