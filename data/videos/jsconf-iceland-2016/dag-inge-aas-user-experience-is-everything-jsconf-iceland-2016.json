    "description": "This talk will not be about a specific technology or another groundbreaking step forwards for JavaScript. Instead, it will focus on one of the most basic things we, as technologists, so often forget. Because your users, be that developers or the average human being, don't fundamentally care about how things work under the hood. All they care about is that it works, and that's it's easy to use. In this talk I will tell you a story of how I came to realise this, and some of the things I think are important for all of us to keep in mind.",
