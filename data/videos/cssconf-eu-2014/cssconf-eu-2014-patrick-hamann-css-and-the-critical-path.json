    "description": "For a website to feel instant, a perceptible response to user input must be provided within hundreds of milliseconds.\n\nThis perceived speed of your website relies heavily on the browser being able to paint to your user's screen. For this they must construct a \"render tree\" which consists of the DOM and the often forgotten CSSOM. The critical path which the browser takes to gather this information is the only thing standing between your server and the user's screen.\n\nUsing new research and real world examples, Patrick will cover a range of techniques \u2013 from the controversial to bleeding edge \u2013 the Guardian are using to make their next generation website load as fast as possible, and ultimately breaking the news to the user within 1000ms.\n\nDuring the talk you will discover why performance matters, what are the common performance bottlenecks in the browser from networking to painting and learn how to best optimise and monitor each stage of the critical path to create fast, jank free websites.\n\nPatrick is a London-based developer, speaker and organiser. He specialises in crafting interfaces and applications that can scale and are accessible across all devices. Currently he works as a senior client-side engineer at The Guardian.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/patrickhamann\nhttp://www.patrickhamann.com/",
