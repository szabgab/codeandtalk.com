He dives deep into the current state of browser support for kerning, hyphenation, justification, and OpenType features. The talk provides an overview of new typographic CSS features, how to use them and when to expect them.\n\nBram Stein is an engineer working on web font serving, type rendering and other web type related features for Adobe Typekit. In his spare time he creates and maintains a large collection of open source JavaScript libraries for improving browser typography.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bram_stein\nhttp://www.bramstein.com",
