    "description": "You've learned the concepts, now meet the tools. High-performance sites need to feel instant and deliver the goods in less than 1000ms. In this talk, learn about the bleeding edge tools that can automate keeping your CSS on the fast path. Automate generating critical-path CSS, removing unused CSS, discovering duplicate selectors, colors and more.\n\nAlong the way, we might even optimize a well known conference site and send them a pull request to help keep the web fast. The tools we'll discuss can be used with Grunt, Gulp, Make or horse so strap yourself in and get ready for a ride into the crazier side of CSS performance optimization.\n\nADDY OSMANI\n\nAddy Osmani is an engineer at Google focusing on tools to help improve developer productivity and satisfaction.
