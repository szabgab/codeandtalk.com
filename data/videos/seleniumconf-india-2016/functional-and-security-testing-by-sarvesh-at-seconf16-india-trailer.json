    "description": "With increasing cyber threats & online attacks, an unavoidable situation for continuous security testing has emerged. Making sure all vulnerabilities are unleashed regularly is highly significant.\n\nThe paper hence proposes a solution where automated security testing could be achieved in conjunction with functional testing carried out using selenium API.\n\nIt introduces a framework that caters to automated security testing along with functional which could provide an integrated testing elucidation.\n\nThe paper, takes in these two premises to offer a solution where functional automation testers can now take on security testing. I propose a framework where automated security testing could be achieved in conjunction with functional testing using existing selenium API scripts.\n\nThe framework covers the top vulnerabilities and provides intuitive results that help a non-security tester interpret and act on the output. At the very core of this framework is the open source tool, OWASP ZAP, which is easy to use and integrates well with Selenium automation frameworks.\n\nI bring in hands on project experience having implemented this framework for clients, who have been able to get the value of functional and security testing using the same set of scripts â€“ it is this experience I would like to share with the SeleniumConf2016 audience, to help groom functional testers into security testing, with minimal cost and time, also enabling security testing to be performed every time functional automation is taken up.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2404\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in",
