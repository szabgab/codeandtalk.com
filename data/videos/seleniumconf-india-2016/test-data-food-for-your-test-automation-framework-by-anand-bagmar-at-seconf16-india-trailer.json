  "description": "Building a Test Automation Framework is easy - there are so many resources / guides / blogs / etc. available to help you get started and help solve the issues you get along the journey.\n\nTeams already building 1000s of tests of various types - UI, web service-based, integration, unit, etc. is a proof of that.\n\nHowever, building a \"good\" Test Automation Framework is not very easy. There are a lot of principles and practices you need to use, in the right context, with a good set of skills required to make the Test Automation Framework maintainable, scalable and reusable.\n\nIn this talk, we will focus on one of the critical aspects and patterns in building the Test Automation framework - Test Data!\n\nWe will look at different data patterns as options and techniques how to create, manage, use, reuse Test Data in a way to keep the tests running in an reliable and deterministic way. We will also discuss what questions to ask, what things to think about in selecting your approach for Test Data!\n\nThis discussion will be applicable for any type of Test Automation (web / mobile / desktop), but, we will focus primarily on UI automation frameworks, ex. using Selenium.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2437\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in",
