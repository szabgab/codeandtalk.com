    "description": "I know what you’re thinking: the creators of WinRunner, QTP/UFT are now embracing Selenium?\n\nTen years after Selenium came into existence as an open source alternative to Mercury Interactive, the perception and relationship between QTP and Selenium has morphed from competition to collaboration with complementary test automation frameworks.\n\nJoin Ori Bendet, HPE Inbound Product Manager for Functional Testing to discuss how HPE’s R&D uses Selenium and other open source tools. Understand the new roles and responsibilities of dev/test @HPE and how they fit into current team structure. Discover their lessons learned about how Selenium and open source has contributed to the success and maturity of HPE's own quality assurance and testing tools across the entire portfolio.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2450\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in",
