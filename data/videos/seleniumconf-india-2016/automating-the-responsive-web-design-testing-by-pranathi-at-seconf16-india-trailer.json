    "description": "Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience like easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).\n\nResponsive web design is becoming more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic. This trend is so prevalent that Google has begun to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device. This has the net effect of penalizing sites that are not mobile friendly.\n\nThe responsive web design responds to the needs of the users and the devices theyâ€™re using. The layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device and provides the enhanced user-experience by re-structuring the contents as per the end-user devices. With plethora devices releasing every day, this has gained significance in the web designing and along with it came the testing challenges. In this talk, we are going to discuss the challenges in testing RWD websites and how to overcome those by using the tools available online.\n\nI have chosen Galen tool to demonstrate the automation of Responsive web design testing. Come and experience the talk to be enlightened about this new found tool :)\n\nWhy Galen?\n\nGalen is an open source framework built for responsive websites. It provides the feasibility to test the various pages on screen sizes and browsers. The test and spec files can be written in plain English which makes it easier for the business people to understand and contribute.
