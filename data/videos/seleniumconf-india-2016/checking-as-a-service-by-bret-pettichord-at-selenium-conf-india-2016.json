  "description": "This talk suggests a reframe in how we understand the business value of automated testing. One shift is to see automation as \"checking\" rather than \"testing\". Another is the shift from software delivery to service delivery, including fully embracing DevOps. The resulting approach could be called Checking as a Service or CheckOps, and forces us to rethink traditional automation priorities. In this talk, Bret will explain how change in approach has affected teams he's worked with and how you can use it to improve your ability to deliver valued services.\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2311/checking-as-a-service",
