    "description": "The opportunities for the Internet of Things are staggering, with estimates in the order of millions of developers, billions of devices, and trillions of dollars over the next decade or less. With numbers like those it is to be expected that the investment levels from industry and venture capital will be staggering. But much of this investment is ignoring one fundamental truth: the basic building blocks of the Internet of Things are going to be built on top of free and open source software. Business models that expect to achieve market dominance based on proprietary business models are going to fail. My talk will discuss some of the underlying trends that will drive this outcome.\n\nConference: http://eclipsesummit.in/\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/eclipse-summit-2016/proposal/2802/open-iot",
