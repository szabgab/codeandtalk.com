  "description": "This talk will explain the secret of the success of the Eclipse Platform team. The Eclipse Way is an agile software development process that we started right at the beginning when we started to develop Eclipse back in 1999. It was and is used by the Eclipse Platform team and got continuously improved over time. During the session you will hear about all our practices, like milestones, early and iterative planning, continuous integration and the endgame. I will also reveal some of the history behind the Eclipse top-level project.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/eclipse-summit-2016/proposal/2386/the-eclipse-way\n\nConference: http://eclipsesummit.in/",
