  "description": "Julia is a modern language that combines the productivity of Python, R, Matlab, and SAS with the performance of C, Fortran and Java. In doing so, it solves the two language problem, where specialists write algorithms in a scripting language and then programmers deploy it in a systems language.\n\nIn this talk, I will share our experience about the evolution of the Julia community - how it grew from 3 contributors to 500, and from 0 to 1000 packages in the last 3 years.\n\nConference: http://eclipsesummit.in/\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/eclipse-summit-2016/proposal/3078/building-an-open-source-community",
