    "description": "Project Valhalla is an experimental OpenJDK project to develop major new language features for consideration for inclusion beyond Java 9. The project was announced in July 2014 and has seen brisk prototyping efforts since then. This talk will offer a highly speculative sneak preview of the advanced features currently in development for the Java language and virtual machine under this banner. In particular, the presentation will cover the motivation, challenges and state of development of two of the key Valhalla features viz, Value types and Generic Specialization.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/eclipse-summit-2016/proposal/2742/beyond-java-9-an-overview-of-project-valhalla\n\nConference: http://eclipsesummit.in/",
