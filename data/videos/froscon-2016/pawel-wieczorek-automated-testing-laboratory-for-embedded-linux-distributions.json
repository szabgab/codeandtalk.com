    "description": "Shipping quality software always involves in-depth testing. In order to minimize time spent on repetitive actions, this task should be fully automated. During this talk Pawe\u0142 will discuss key problems faced while building automatic testing infrastructure for Tizen operating system images. He will also present how Tizen release team dealt with this task. Both hardware and software presented in this talk is open-sourced and can be easily used to build embedded software testing lab.\n\nPawe\u0142 Wieczorek",
