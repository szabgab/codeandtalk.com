    "description": "I will discuss how it took me nearly 25 years to produce a 40-page book: the writing, typesetting and binding of my mock\u2013mock-epic poem The Youth Hostel, and how this led to my hacking on LaTeX font support, taking over the maintainership of psutils, becoming a Debian Maintainer, and working for Google.
