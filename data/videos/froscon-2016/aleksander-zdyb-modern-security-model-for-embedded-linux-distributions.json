    "description": "Security and privacy of information stored on embedded devices is gaining on importance. It turns out that security models designed for desktops and servers cannot be directly adopted in embedded devices. Moreover desktop systems themselves seem to lag behind, when it comes to accessing privilege-oriented resources like camera, microphone or address book. Aleksander will show how growing security requirements for operating systems are fulfilled with usage of existing Linux mechanisms, like MAC or DAC and new ones, like Cynara and Security Manager. You will have a chance to learn the complete security framework implemented in Tizen operating system and Linux Foundation's Automotive Grade Linux and get to know how well designed solution can provide security and privacy for whole system, relieving efforts of 3rd-party developers.\n\nAleksander Zdyb",
