    "description": "Buy hardware, write software -- this is the basic rule we in the FLOSS community followed for many years. But things are changing. Today it is easier than ever before to create own digital hardware, aka. \"chips.\"\n\nIn this talk I'll show give a introduction into what (in terms of tools, knowledge and other factors) is required to get a digital hardware design up and running. I'll also show how to get started: where can I find the community to get help and existing code? What existing projects can I contribute to?\n\nPhilipp Wagner",
