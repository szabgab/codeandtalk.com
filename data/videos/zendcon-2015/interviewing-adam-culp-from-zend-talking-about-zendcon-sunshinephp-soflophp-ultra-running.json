    "description": "This interview features Adam Culp (http://twitter.com/adamculp) from Zend (http://zend.com). Adam is the organizer of ZendCon (http://zendcon.com), SunshinePHP (http://sunshinephp.com) & SoFloPHP (http://soflophp.org).\n\nThe chat we had was recorded in the green room of The Joint (https://www.hardrockhotel.com/las-vegas-concerts/the-joint), the concert venue of the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. \n\nThe setting had a great Rock 'n Roll vibe to it and it facilitated a great conversation with Adam. We talked about organizing ZendCon and how it differs from organizing SunshinePHP and running the South Florida PHP user group. \n\nWe also talk about Adam's passion for ultra running. He has a running blog called \"Crazy Floridian\" (http://www.crazyfloridian.com) and a podcast called \"Run Geek Radio\" (https://rungeekradio.com) where he talks about both PHP and running.\n\nThanks to Adam for organizing these great conferences. I'm very fortunate to have attended some of them. In the interview I tell some stories of interesting things that happened while I was there.\n\n► Follow me on Twitter - http://twitter.com/ThijsFeryn\n► Read my blog - http://blog.feryn.eu\n► Check my presentations - http://talks.feryn.eu\n► Thanks to Combell for sponsoring the show - http://www.combell.com",
