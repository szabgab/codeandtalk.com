  "description": "Growing a business does not just imply selling more products and getting more customers; one of the biggest challenges is supporting that growing customer-base in handling their acquired products. With growth comes an increase in potential errors, bugs, and struggles. So how does a growing tech company scale support?\n\nAt WooThemes we get about 10,000 ticket submissions per month, which stands in big contrast with the almost 500,000 visitors of our public support resources. This talk will focus on finding a good balance between providing a stable public resource and answering urgent ticket requests, and the mistakes and wins we've encountered along the way.",
