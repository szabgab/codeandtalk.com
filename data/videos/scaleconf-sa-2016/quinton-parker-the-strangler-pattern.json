    "description": "If a large, complex, legacy (and monolith?) software system could be thought of as a boeing and the users its passengers. This talk is about a powerful (but not new) strategy to replace the jet engines (performance) whilst simultaneously enabling more passengers to embark mid-flight (scalability) without anybody getting killed in the process (developers included).\n\nThis talk will showcase real-world and practical concepts, pragmatic thinking, microservice adoption, silly mistakes, and unusual software pattern mashups employed by Spree engineering teams on our journey to a preferable ecommerce platform.",
