    "description": "Aimee Knight\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that engineers are in high demand. Bootcamps are popping up everywhere, and while they\u2019re churning out highly motivated juniors, often it\u2019s seniors that companies are really after. So how do we bridge this gap together? On the surface it often looks like we\u2019ve \u2018naturally\u2019 developed into our current roles. And, as we progress it\u2019s incredibly easy to forget what it was like being new. Rest assured however, for most the journey has been filled with a whole lot of grit, determination, and discipline.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll discuss lessons learned one year after going from a bootcamp grad, to a full time JavaScript developer. Plan to walk away empowered, and with renewed passion for the incredible industry we\u2019re all a part of!",
