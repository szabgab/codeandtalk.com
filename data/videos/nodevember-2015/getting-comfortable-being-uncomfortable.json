    "description": "Aimee Knight\n\nThere’s no denying that engineers are in high demand. Bootcamps are popping up everywhere, and while they’re churning out highly motivated juniors, often it’s seniors that companies are really after. So how do we bridge this gap together? On the surface it often looks like we’ve ‘naturally’ developed into our current roles. And, as we progress it’s incredibly easy to forget what it was like being new. Rest assured however, for most the journey has been filled with a whole lot of grit, determination, and discipline.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss lessons learned one year after going from a bootcamp grad, to a full time JavaScript developer. Plan to walk away empowered, and with renewed passion for the incredible industry we’re all a part of!",
