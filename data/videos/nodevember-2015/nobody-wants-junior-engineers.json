    "description": "Hunter Loftis \n\nOriginally scheduled to give \"Don't make me refresh\", Hunter reached out and asked to give the talk \"Nobody Wants Junior Engineers\", and we thought it was great. (Kindly ignore title card ;) )\n\n\nTech companies are offering huge salaries, great benefits, and cool jobs to senior engineers. But few of these companies advertise junior or entry-level positions! What gives? How do people get into this industry?\n\nThis talk will explore the reality of career development in our field - and the hacks you can use to get your foot in the door. You'll leave ready to lose that 'junior' part of your title by beating senior engineers at their own game.",
