    "description": "Adam Miskiewicz\n\nFacebook is no longer the only company with mobile apps powered by React Native in the App Store.\n\nReact Native is new, but it’s more than just a toy. It’s an extremely powerful and efficient way to build mobile applications.\n\nLet’s go beyond the React Native docs and talk about how to build performant and production-ready React Native applications.I’ll discuss:\n\n* Using React (web) best practices in a native environment (with Redux, Relay, and GraphQL)\n* Why you shouldn’t be scared of bridging native code\n* How to plan ahead for easy, cross-platform React Native development\n* Leveraging continuous integration (and deployment) for your React Native apps\n* This talk should leave you convinced that React Native should be your (or your organization’s) mobile platform of choice.",
