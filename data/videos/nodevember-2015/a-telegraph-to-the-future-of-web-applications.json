    "description": "Derick Bailey\n\nThe future of the web is found in technology as old as paper, as revolutionary as the telegraph, and as unique as a fast food restaurant: messaging.\n\nIn the real world, messages are used to coordinated activities, make things happen and send back results. They\u2019re everywhere in our daily lives - and on the web! From HTTP to AJAX with XML and JSON documents, to Web Workers and iFrames, to scaling the back-end of Node.js and other servers with ease, web development is steeped in the communication patterns that we use every day.\n\nIt\u2019s time, then, to recognize messaging for what it is: the past, present and future of the web!\n\nIn this session, you\u2019ll learn what messaging is and how messaging patterns are part of your work, already. You\u2019ll see the benefit of making these implicit patterns explicit in your code. And, you\u2019ll learn how messaging can take your architecture from a flock of seagull\u2019s screaching \u201cMINE! MINE! MINE!\u201d, to a highly trained and coordinated team.",
