    "description": "Adam Miskiewicz\n\nFacebook is no longer the only company with mobile apps powered by React Native in the App Store.\n\nReact Native is new, but it\u2019s more than just a toy. It\u2019s an extremely powerful and efficient way to build mobile applications.\n\nLet\u2019s go beyond the React Native docs and talk about how to build performant and production-ready React Native applications.I\u2019ll discuss:\n\n* Using React (web) best practices in a native environment (with Redux, Relay, and GraphQL)\n* Why you shouldn\u2019t be scared of bridging native code\n* How to plan ahead for easy, cross-platform React Native development\n* Leveraging continuous integration (and deployment) for your React Native apps\n* This talk should leave you convinced that React Native should be your (or your organization\u2019s) mobile platform of choice.",
