  "description": "Chris Keathley\nData visualization lives in the intersection between art and science.  A good visualization allows us to analyze our data and begin to ask compelling questions.  Data visuals tell us a story.  However, knowing how to find that story is hard and knowing how to tell that story visually can be even harder.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at some classic data visualization techniques and best practices and show how we can use modern tools like Javascript and D3 to implement them.  Along with a practical and interactive demonstration of the tools we'll also look at several examples of well made visuals and explore the techniques that they employ.",
