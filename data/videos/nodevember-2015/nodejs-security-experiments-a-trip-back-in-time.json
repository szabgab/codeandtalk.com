    "description": "Adam Baldwin\n\n4 years ago I fell in love with node.js at 0.4 ever since then I\u2019ve been focused on finding ways to 0wn and secure node applications. A lot of that effort was focused around the npm registry where the majority of the code developers produce is shared and consumed.\n\nThis talk will be a trip back in time to discuss the mad science research and experiments I\u2019ve done to try and understand the state of node.js security and to try and make the node community and ecosystem a bit more secure.\n\nHopefully it will leave you with a healthy sense of paranoia and a curiosity for how you can make the code you create and consume more secure.",
