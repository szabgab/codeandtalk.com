    "description": "Michael Chan\n\nThe styling of React components is a contentious topic in 2015.\n\nIt challenges everything we know about styling apps. In this talk, we’ll take a practical look at styling components in JavaScript: good practices, libraries, testing, and how to expose great APIs for distributed components.\n\nWe’ll explore when styling in JavaScript is a great fit and when it might be best to \"just use CSS.\"",
