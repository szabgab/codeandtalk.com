    "description": "Scott Southworth\n&lt;p&gt;Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s build the iconic TodoMVC application (http://todomvc.com/), but without the whole MVC thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&CloseCurlyQuote;ll declare everything in terms of reactive data flows. We&CloseCurlyQuote;ll design a user-interface using pure, raw HTML for our templates. All of our content and programming logic will load lazily, composing itself like turtles holding turtles all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a talk for those who wish Javascript had Unity3D&CloseCurlyQuote;s behaviors, Adobe Flex&CloseCurlyQuote;s component/module architecture or the simplicity of Excel.&lt;/p&gt;",
