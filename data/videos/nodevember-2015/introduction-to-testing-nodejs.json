    "description": "Jordan Kasper\nTesting is challenging.\n\nTesting JavaScript is downright painful.\n\nThat said, the benefits of testing your code cannot be overlooked. If you want to sleep easy at night knowing that your latest code merge didn’t break everything then you need to test everything. In this tutorial we’ll walk through some strategies for testing Node.js applications. This includes module patterns and strategies for dependency injection in your tests. We’ll introduce developers to the Mocha framework and how to write good tests and assertions, including proper setup and teardown methods.\n\nAttendees will walk away from this session with a solid starting point to implement unit tests in their own Node.js code and some ideas for refactoring applications to allow for better testing.",
