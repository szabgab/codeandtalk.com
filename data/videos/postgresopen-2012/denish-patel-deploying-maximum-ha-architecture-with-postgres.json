    "description": "Enterprises use of PostgreSQL database servers is to reduce licensing cost without affecting their high availability need of IT infrastructure . Application downtime and unavailability of data directly translate into lost productivity and revenue, dissatisfied customers.Since PostgreSQL 9.0, achieving enterprise level of maximum HA architecture solutions using PostgreSQL is very easy.\n\nIn this presentation, I discuss the common causes of application and/or server downtime and discuss how technologies available in the PostgreSQL Database can help avoid costly downtime and enable rapid recovery from unplanned failures and also minimize impact from planned outages. We also highlight new technologies introduced in PostgreSQL Release 9 that enable businesses to make their IT infrastructure even more robust and fault tolerant, maximize their return on investment on high availability infrastructure, and provide better quality of service to users. Unplanned downtime: − Server Availability − Data Availability Planned Downtime − OS changes − Data Changes − Database Upgrades",
