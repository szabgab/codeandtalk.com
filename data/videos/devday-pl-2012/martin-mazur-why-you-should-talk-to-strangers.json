Not talking to strangers means never leaving your comfort zone, never exploring anything new and never learning anything beyond that what is familiar.\n\nIn this talk we explore how being unfaithful to mainstream class-base OO languages will make you a better developer; how other languages and other ways of thinking will give you a competitive edge over your peers.\n\nDo you want some candy?\"",
