    "description": "Augury is a Chrome Developer Tools extension that allows developers to visualize their Angular 2.0 applicationâ€™s component tree and the data associated with it. Our goal with this project is two-fold: help developers find bugs in their Angular 2.0 applications but also allow them to visualize their applications and their higher level structure at runtime. Our long term vision is also to help developers optimize the performance of their application using this tool. Augury itself is an open source effort started at Rangle.io and is developed using TypeScript and Angular 2.0.",
