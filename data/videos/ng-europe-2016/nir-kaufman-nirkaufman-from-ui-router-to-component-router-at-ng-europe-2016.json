    "description": "Angular2 introduced a brand new powerful router. For those of us who have been developing with Angular 1.x for years, it requires a change in the way we perceive routing. Since Angular2 requires composing Component Trees instead of MVC ‘views’, we have much more flexibility then ever before. During this talk Nir will help you make the switch from UI-Router/NG-router to the component router through a series of side by side comparison of all key features. Topics to be covered: - Configuring the component router - Passing route parameters - Creating nested routes - Hooking to the router lifecycle - Side by side feature comparison of UI router and Component router.",
