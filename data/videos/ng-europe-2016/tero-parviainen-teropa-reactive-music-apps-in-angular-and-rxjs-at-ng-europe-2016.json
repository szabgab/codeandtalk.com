    "description": "Angular 2 combined with RxJS, @ngrx/store, and Immutable.js is a fantastic platform for reactive web applications. If we also add hot loading and the Web Audio API to the mix, we end up with something truly exciting: A platform for reactive music creation. This talk is about creating musical systems on the Angular platform.
