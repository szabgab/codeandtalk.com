    "description": "\"Enhancing Responsiveness With Flexbox\": Flexbox and responsive web design go great together, like peanut butter and jelly! Flexbox gives you more control over the things you care about in a responsive layout and lets you create much morecomplex and reliable layouts than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block. All with far less CSS.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn what flexbox features are particularly suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them by applying flexbox as a progressive enhancement. We’ll look at examples of responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a good experience.\n\nZoe is a senior designer for Booking.com. She is the author of two books on CSS and visual web design, and she recently wrote the chapter on flexbox for Smashing Magazine’s new Real-Life Responsive Web Design book.\n\nhttp://2015.cssconf.eu/",
