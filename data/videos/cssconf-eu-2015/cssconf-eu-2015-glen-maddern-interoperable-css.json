    "description": "There have been a lot of ideas and a lot of speculation about the future of CSS in the last year or so, largely driven by the ingenuity of the React community. Will we write styling code purely in JS? Will CSS continue to be useful? Will someone concoct some X-files-style JS+CSS alien-human hybrid language that takes over the world? It\u2019s all possible (mostly).\n\nThis talk is about a new format for CSS, one that\u2019s now supported by default in Webpack & JSPM, and available with plugins for Browserify. It\u2019s called Interoperable CSS, and it hopes to do for CSS what CommonJS did for JavaScript.\n\nGlen Maddern is an independent web developer from Melbourne, Australia. He also organizes CSSconf AU, and does rad web stuff.\n\nhttp://2015.cssconf.eu/",
