  "description": "By, Aaron Wolf\nSoftware freedom advocates sometimes believe a myth of \"trickle-down technology\" \u2014 that open collaboration and freedom for programmers will somehow lead to more free and open technology for the rest of society. To build technology that truly empowers most people, we need more non-programmers actively involved in development.\n\nI'll share my story of how I started as a music teacher and became the co-founder of an ambitious Free/Libre/Open project. We'll discus lessons about outreach to others like me.",
