    "description": "Asynchronous I/O frameworks like Node, Twisted, Tornado, and Python 3.4\u2019s new \u201casyncio\u201d can efficiently scale past tens of thousands of concurrent connections. But async coding with callbacks is painful and error-prone. Programmers increasingly use coroutines in place of callbacks to get the best of both worlds: efficiency plus a natural and robust coding style. I\u2019ll explain how asyncio\u2019s coroutines work. They are built using Python generators, the \u201cyield from\u201d statement, and the Future and Task classes. You will gain a deep understanding of this miraculous new programming idiom in the Python standard library.",
