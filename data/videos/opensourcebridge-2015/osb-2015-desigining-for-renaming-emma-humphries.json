  "description": "Renaming yourself is never easy. In Santa Clara County in the State of California, to file a petition to change one's name costs over $400, and may take six months or more. Then one must change one's name (and possibly one's gender marker) on the dozens of sites and services one uses.\n\nOn many sites, that's easy, I go to preferences and edit my name.\n\nBut then the site addresses me as \"Mr. Emma Humphries,\" oh really?\n\nOther systems will correctly greet me as \"Emma\" when I log in. But still call me by $DEAD_NAME when they send an email.\n\nThis brings us to the first best practice:\n\nWhen I change my name in one place, change it in all the places.",
