    "description": "http://front-trends.com\n\nWebGL is normally associated with 3D graphics, which can seem daunting without a background in this field. However, the WebGL API is inherently 2D, merely supplying a very useful toolbox of functionality for creating 3D engines.\nIn this talk, we’ll explore how WebGL can be used to manipulate 2D graphics, by creating a simple image editing application. Through live-coding, we’ll see that working with WebGL isn’t all that complicated and can be achieved without having to reach for higher level frameworks, and how hardware accelerated image effects like color changes, deformations or blurs can be implemented in a few lines of code.\n\nSlides: http://felixpalmer.github.io/photo.gl/presentation?full#1",
