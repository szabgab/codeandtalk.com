  "description": "http://front-trends.com/\n\nThe world of a front-end developer has never been more complex. The rate at which new libraries, devices, protocols, and even languages are appearing can be dizzying. Meanwhile, the capabilities of the platform are exploding, and so are our expectations. Our tools can barely keep up, and we can barely keep up with them.\n\nIf it\u2019s hard for us, imagine what it\u2019s like for someone new to all this. For us, the days of throwing a HTML, CSS and JS file in a directory are long gone, but that\u2019s still usually where we tell people to start. That is the web of a generation ago, and we forget how hostile it was. Our tools, while impenetrably complex to a newcomer, make the web a happier place to work.\n\nWhat if the tools we used weren\u2019t so impenetrable though? What if people, regardless of experience, could build the web like we do?\n\nSlides: https://imgur.com/a/2VrLu",
