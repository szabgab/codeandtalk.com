C\u2019mon dude, we all know that it\u2019s possible to make a game in web technologies that run on mobile phone, fridge, printer, gaming console and etc. JUST STAHP! AGAIN? JS games are soooo 2011!\n\nIf any of the above was you first thought, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. During this talk I\u2019ll present my journey from JavaScript to real board games. These are the games you played with your friends on rainy days 30 years ago. You\u2019re probably wondering how the hell you can write a board version of Chess or Monopoly using JavaScript. Everything will be explained in this Front-Trends talk!",
