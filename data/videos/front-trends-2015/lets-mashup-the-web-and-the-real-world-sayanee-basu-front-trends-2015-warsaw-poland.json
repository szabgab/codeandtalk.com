As sensors and hardware platforms become more available for hobbyists, web developers can also have fun with the real world by triggering and sensing.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover how we can utilise the plenty of sensors already embedded in our mobile phones, to different wireless protocols such as the WiFi or Bluetooth Low Energy as well as some low power devices. Then we will hook them up to a display or trigger them with various web technologies right in our browser.\n\nIf you are looking to start playing with hardware and web technologies, this talk will give you an overview of common hardware platforms, javascript libraries, as well as beginners’ sensors. And yes, audience participation will be required in this talk, so let’s have some fun!\n\nSlides: http://mashup.sayan.ee/#/",
