When there was nobody stalking you to move a button 2px to the left? When there was no philosophy behind the placement of a search field?\nAnyway… these days are gone, baby. UX is here to stay, at least for some time, so let’s figure out ways to work together. In the end we all want to make things we are proud of.\nWe’ll learn what you can actually request from your UX team (guess what, it’s not just prototypes!), when to speak up and how to communicate with UX folks to be effective.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/nrozycka/ux-terror-know-your-rights-front-trends-2015",
