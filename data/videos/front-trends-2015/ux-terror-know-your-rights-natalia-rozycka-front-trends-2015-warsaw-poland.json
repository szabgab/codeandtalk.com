  "description": "http://front-trends.com/\n\nDo you miss the times when Front-End devs were called Web MASTERS? When you did not have to wait for ages for someone else to design a simple form? When there was nobody stalking you to move a button 2px to the left? When there was no philosophy behind the placement of a search field?\nAnyway\u2026 these days are gone, baby. UX is here to stay, at least for some time, so let\u2019s figure out ways to work together. In the end we all want to make things we are proud of.\nWe\u2019ll learn what you can actually request from your UX team (guess what, it\u2019s not just prototypes!), when to speak up and how to communicate with UX folks to be effective.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/nrozycka/ux-terror-know-your-rights-front-trends-2015",
