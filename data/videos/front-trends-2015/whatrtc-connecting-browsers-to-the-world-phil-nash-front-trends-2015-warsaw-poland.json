WebRTC is a small set of APIs that make peer to peer communication possible between browsers. Video, audio and data can flow from browser to browser opening up a new set of possibilities for the web.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a look at what WebRTC gives you and, importantly, what it leaves out. We\u2019ll cover implementing a simple chat application and speculate over more complicated use cases and examples. I\u2019ll also demo new real-time video infrastructure based on WebRTC.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/philnash/whatrtc-everything-you-need-to-know-to-connect-browsers-to-the-world-front-trends-2015",
