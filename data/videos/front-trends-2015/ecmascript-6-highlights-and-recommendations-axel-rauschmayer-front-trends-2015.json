I\u2019ll give a brief overview of its features and will tell you what I make of them (spoiler: it\u2019s mostly good news). The talk concludes with a demonstration of a few cool things that you can do with ES6.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/rauschma/ecmascript-6-highlights-and-recommendations",
