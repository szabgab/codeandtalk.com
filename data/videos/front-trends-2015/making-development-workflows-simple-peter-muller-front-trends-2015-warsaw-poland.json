    "description": "http://front-trends.com/\n\nIn a world of ever-increasing complexity in compilers, build systems, tests and tools that all have to integrate with each other, it seems that developers have lost their intuition of what is simple. Getting into web development has never had a steeper learning curve and nobody seems to be addressing the fact that this might hurt our community in the long run by scaring newcomers.\n\nIn this talk, I will focus on precompilers and transpilers and the workflow and tooling around them. I want to bring us closer to a more comprehensible abstraction and a simpler API that will let the current and future generations of web developers focus on the work, rather than the tools.",
