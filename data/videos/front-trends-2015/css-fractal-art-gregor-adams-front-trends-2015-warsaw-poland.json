In his talk, Gregor will show how he found love for fractals and started making them in CSS or Sass. You can expect to see a step-by-step guide to creating CSS fractals and experiments from simple to complex.\nThen he will explain how to connect these fractals to the webAudio API and create optical effects that are generated by music. All in all you will see some amazing structures and visuals. Sit tight some of these experiments might make you think there was something funny in that last drink.\nBut we can assure you, it\u2019s pure CSS. If you are into visuals and talks with a lot of action and live examples this is the perfect talk for you.\n\nSlides: http://slides.pixelass.com/fronttrends2015/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0",
