    "description": "I invite you for a story about things you can do as developers to keep developing yourself. I will tell you about workshops, hackathons, code review techniques, blog writing, attending and speaking at conferences, sharing knowledge and a lot more. All those activities support learning new things, experimenting and having fun. Without that we have only our day-to-day job that can be tough or boring. Everything comes from my personal experience. I will show you examples with do’s and don’ts. I will share lot’s of tips how to introduce those techniques at your work.",
