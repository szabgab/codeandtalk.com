    "description": "The way software is developed and run in production has changed dramatically over the past ten years. These changes are just now reaching the “mainstream” who are looking to respond to the idea that “software is eating the world” and use software like all the “unicorns” we read about in the market. Getting your advice strictly from unicorn companies can feel a lot like getting dieting advice from celebrities: it sure will work if you have unlimited resources, few constraints, and, well, are already successful.
