    "description": "Sputnik.ci checks quality of contributions to GitHub projects saving developers time. It supports Java, Groovy and Scala projects build with Maven or Gradle.\n\nIt runs static code analyzers like Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs, Scalastyle, CodeNarc, JSLint.\n\nOn every pull-request Sputnik initiates analysis of code that has been changed. If any Sputnik rule is violated you should expect to see comments in GitHub or in Sputnik. Weâ€™re working on adding support for other languages (Python, Swift) and repository hosting services.\n\nhttps://sputnik.ci/ https://github.com/TouK/sputnik-ci/wiki https://twitter.com/TouK_pl https://twitter.com/sputnikCI",
