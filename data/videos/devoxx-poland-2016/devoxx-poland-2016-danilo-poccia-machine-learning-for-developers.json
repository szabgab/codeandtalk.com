    "description": "Have you always wanted to add predictive capabilities to your application, but havenâ€™t been able to find the time or the right technology to get started? Everybody wants to build smart apps, but only a few are Data Scientists. We had the same issue inside Amazon, so we created a Machine Learning engine that Developers can easily use. The same approach is now available in the AWS cloud. We demonstrate how to use Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) to create machine learning models, deploy them to production, and obtain predictions in real-time. We then demonstrate how to build a complete smart application using Amazon ML, Amazon Kinesis, and AWS Lambda. We walk you through the process flow and architecture, demonstrate outcomes, and then dive into the implementation. In this session, you learn how to use Amazon ML as well as how to integrate Amazon ML into your applications to take advantage of predictive analysis in the cloud.",
