It’s all about outcomes and the way your organisation is structured has a tremendous impact on those outcomes. it’s easy to say “Conway’s Law” and then move swiftly on. “But but but, but how?”\n\nIn early 2014, James and Martin Fowler called out “Organised around business capabilities“ as a core characteristic of microservices.
