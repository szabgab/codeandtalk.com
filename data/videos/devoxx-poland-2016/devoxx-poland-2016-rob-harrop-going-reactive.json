    "description": "Reactive architectures are becoming ever more popular in the Java world as developers come to understand the benefits to code comprehension, de-coupling and testability.\n\nWork is already underway to standardise a set of Reactive Stream APIs and in Java 9, we'll see Reactive as a core part of the JDK with the Flow API. Now is the time to learn how to get the most from the Reactive model.\n\nIn this talk, attendees will learn both the why and the how of Reactive Java. We'll start with a brief history of Reactive to understand what problems it solves, and why we might want to fit it into our applications. The majority of the session focusses on how to use Reactive Java and attendees will learn how to:\n- Identify and use the common Reactive patterns\n- De-couple parts of their applications using Reactive components\n- Improve testability of their components using Reactive\n- Use Reactive as a model for asynchronous processing in a real application",
