    "description": "Integration tests are hard especially in distributed environments where many applications talk to each other. When we add continuous deployment approach it's becoming impossible to ensure two independently deployed services will integrate properly. Fortunately there is the Accurest. Tool that verifies contracts based on HTTP calls or messaging without integrating real applications. During this talk we'll show how to validate communication between services as a part of deployment pipeline without deploying even single application.",
