    "description": "The Kotlin programming language is gaining popularity nowadays. It’s a modern language that gives more power in everyday routines. Kotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it’s much easier to work with when you have less verbosity or code duplication.\n\nBut what’s even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling. It’s a pragmatic language with a very low learning curve, and can be quickly grasped by Java developers.\n\nIn this talk we’ll discuss the concepts of the language that provide the desired expressiveness, and see how Kotlin solves the tasks you have to cope with regularly.",
