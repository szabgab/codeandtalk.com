    "description": "Once your application is developed, switching it to live production is a painful experience. From process management, deployment, monitoring, bug tracking, orchestration... a lot of techniques and methodologies must be taken into account to provide a quality application. This is where PM2 comes into the game, providing a framework to harden your Node.js application and super charge your production workflow.\n\nAlexandre is a full stack JavaScript developer, technologist and the author of PM2, a well known process manager for production Node.js applications. He is also CEO & co-founder of the startup keymetrics.io, a supervizion solution built on top of PM2.\n\nJSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 19 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.jsconf.asia\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/unitech/pm2-presentation-at-jsconf-dot-asia\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
