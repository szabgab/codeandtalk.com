    "description": "Cross-functional teams are a popular and on-trend approach to distributing the testing effort across software development. Ebay, Google, Microsoft are some of the more well-known names to have adopted this approach. In these companies, a test lead may oversee and support multiple teams reporting to the head of engineering.\n\nWhere does that leave the concept of test management and test manager? Are these ideas irrelevant in todays agile approach to software development?\n\nAt Tyro Payments, we\u2019ve built a team from 5 to 23 testers in one year. We\u2019ve experimented with test management and the role of test manager. We\u2019ve constantly evolved our ideas about what it meant to lead testing in a high growth organisation.\n\nThis keynote will describe our growth, how we pivoted based on experimentation and learning. It will share some insights and traps to avoid. It will end with ideas about the future of test management and how it might fit into a future, where the only certainty is that testing will look very different to what is is today.\n\n\nCheck more at http://europeantestingconference.eu\nAll the videos from 2016 are at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF5ERStlaHg&list=PL_9ioxG4tU7sz_BwjPjHeLWr2CIoFNT10",
