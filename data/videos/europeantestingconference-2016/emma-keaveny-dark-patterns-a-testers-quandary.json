    "description": "Have you ever found yourself downloading a tool bar you didnâ€™t want? How about suddenly receiving emails because you accidentally signed up for a mailing list? Possibly the worst yet, sent out invites to an application at your own expense? Well if you have, then you have been whacked with a Dark Pattern! These patterns are designed to fool you, into applying or buying things you had no intention of getting. In this presentation I will be going through the different types of dark patterns that are out there, how we should approach these as testers (is there a right way or a wrong way to deal with them), as well as covering some pros and cons on these controversial barely legal techniques that are used more frequently than you would think.\n\nCheck more at http://europeantestingconference.eu\nAll the videos from 2016 are at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF5ERStlaHg&list=PL_9ioxG4tU7sz_BwjPjHeLWr2CIoFNT10",
