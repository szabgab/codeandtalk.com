    "description": "Ever since James Bach and Michael Bolton introduced the Testing and Checking distinctions in to my testing world, I have embraced them. For me, they were the missing piece to my vocabulary regarding testing. I knew there was differences between what my automation was doing and what I was doing, but I couldn\u2019t articulate that. However this isn\u2019t the case for everyone, there are many people who don\u2019t see the benefit in the distinction, and refuse to use them. That\u2019s OK. However for me, I like it, I use it, and I encourage others to use it.\n\nIn this talk I want to share with you my experiences of using the terms in several workplaces. How I\u2019ve had great success in educating others about testing using these terms, and how it\u2019s changed their views on my work. How adopting these distinctions has allowed me to think deeper about the role of automation in testing, and allow me to get the most out of tools. How my communication about my testing has improved, but also how others talk about testing with me has improved, allowing us to align and work smarter and faster.\n\n\nCheck more at http://europeantestingconference.eu\nAll the videos from 2016 are at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF5ERStlaHg&list=PL_9ioxG4tU7sz_BwjPjHeLWr2CIoFNT10",
