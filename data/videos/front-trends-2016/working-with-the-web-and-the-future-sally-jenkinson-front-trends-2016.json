Get'em while they last! https://2017.front-trends.com/ \n\nAs web professionals we\u2019re used to hearing about the virtues of shipping fast and iterating regularly in order to meet changing needs, but how do we ensure that the projects that we\u2019re planning now are still as relevant and robust when they launch in the future\u2026 and beyond? How do we prepare for the unknowns and constant shifts in technology; what can we do to progress the evolution of the web itself; how do we, as individuals, ensure that our skills are as relevant as ever in this rapidly changing world?\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll look at why the future is important, plus past visions of the future, including those from the world of science fiction. We'll explore what we can learn from these lessons, and how to apply this in a practical sense to the work that we do.",
