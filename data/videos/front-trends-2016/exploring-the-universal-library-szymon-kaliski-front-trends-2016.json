    "description": "Early Bird tickets are now on sale for Front-Trends 2017, May 24-26. Get'em while they last! https://2017.front-trends.com/ \n\nThis talk will explore languages, programming, tools, and complicated connections between all of them. We will try to look at expanding possibilities that current technology gives us, with focus on new areas and uses for programming. We'll approach language not only as a tool for creative expression, but also constraint on the way we think.\n\nWe'll try to compare language and meta-thinking with meta-programming, we'll look for similarities in DSLs and linguistic determinism, and how it all fits together when creating art, shaping matter, and making software using computers, with varying degrees of human involvement.\n\nThis will be open talk, hopefully leaving you with more questions than answers.",
