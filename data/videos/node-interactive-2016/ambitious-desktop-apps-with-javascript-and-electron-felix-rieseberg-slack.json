    "description": "Ambitious Desktop Apps with JavaScript and Electron - Felix Rieseberg, Slack\n\nYou may have seen apps like Slack, Visual Studio Code, or Docker’s Kitematic - desktop applications written using Node.js and Chromium. Originally built for the editor Atom, Electron enables developers to build beautiful cross-platform apps, harnessing the power of a being a true Desktop app while using the JavaScript we all love. \n\nThis talk presents the lessons learned on the Electron Core, the app for the blogging platform Ghost, and Visual Studio Code. Built with ordinary JavaScript, Electron Apps are crazy powerful - and run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. In particular, we’ll talk about how to integrate into the operating system, how to handle updates, and how to use all the native powers without creating insecure apps. Come and learn how you can use your favorite web frameworks and libraries together with NodeJS to build your next desktop app!\n\nTo note, when Felix submitted his presentation he was working at Microsoft. He now works at Slack.",
