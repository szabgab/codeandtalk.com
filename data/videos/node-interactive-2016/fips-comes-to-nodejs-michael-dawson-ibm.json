    "description": "FIPS Comes to Node.js - Michael Dawson, IBM\n\nFIPS 140-2 is a cryptographic functionality standard that is often required when handling sensitive information, particularly in government and regulated industries. Support for FIPS was a community request that has been addressed thanks to numerous contributors. Come hear about the journey taken by the Node.js community to allow building and testing a FIPS capable runtime. The talk will cover FIPS requirements, and the specific enablement, test updates, and changes to dependencies that were required. Weâ€™ll include code samples and walkthroughs, and end with an overview of how to use FIPS capable Node.js through sample deployments in the cloud.",
