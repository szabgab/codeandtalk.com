    "description": "The Cost of Logging - Matteo Collina, nearForm\n\nSunday morning and your phone rings: production is down. After two hours, you manage to solve it: you could have fixed it in one minute if you had the right information from the start. First thing in the morning, you add logging everywhere, to avoid this issue and be able to triage and solve problems easily. Then, your application requires twice as much servers to run. This talk is for you: I will introduce you to Pino. It logs in JSON, and itâ€™s up to 17 times faster than traditional loggers, and it comes with nice Express and Hapi integrations.",
