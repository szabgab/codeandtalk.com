    "description": "SWIMming in the Microservices Ocean - Luca Maraschi, nearForm\n\nThis talk aims to speak about the theoretical and practical migration from thinking in services to think in distributed execution blocks. The audience is going to get an introduction on the common problems of scaling HTTP REST based micro-services and how cooperative RPC functions can facilitate our lives. Designing and deployment are going to be the main focus, with a final focus on how to operate such an architecture at scale (from development, to people and finally to production). When software and hardware can scale performances at unimaginable boundaries, people and operations are forced to follow and that’s where most of the time all of these becomes complex and unmaintainable…but we have a solution for that.",
