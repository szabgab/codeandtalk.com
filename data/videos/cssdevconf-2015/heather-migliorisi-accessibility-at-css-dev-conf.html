Recently, several companies have launched amazing new sites that feature improvements in performance, responsiveness and the hotness of HTML5 and CSS3.

These are great accomplishments; however what many forget to improve is the accessibility of the site.

  <li>How to handle forms and errors</li>
  <li>Proposed features in the W3C pipeline</li>
  <li>Testing techniques and automation</li>
  <li>How to ensure company-wide standards</li>
</ul>

First rule of ARIA: Don't use ARIA.
