    "description": "Rum is a React-based ClojureScript web framework with ability to render static pages on JVM. It’s specifically designed to be simple, small, extensible and unopinionated. In this talk we’ll explore Rum features, philosophy behind its design, differences from other frameworks, best practices, and how to set up your application so that it’ll be served pre-rendered, but work interactively once it’s loaded.\n\nSlides: http://clojutre.org/2016/slides/Isomorphic-web-apps-with-rum.pdf",
