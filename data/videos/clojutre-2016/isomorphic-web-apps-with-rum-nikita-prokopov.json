  "description": "Rum is a React-based ClojureScript web framework with ability to render static pages on JVM. It\u2019s specifically designed to be simple, small, extensible and unopinionated. In this talk we\u2019ll explore Rum features, philosophy behind its design, differences from other frameworks, best practices, and how to set up your application so that it\u2019ll be served pre-rendered, but work interactively once it\u2019s loaded.\n\nSlides: http://clojutre.org/2016/slides/Isomorphic-web-apps-with-rum.pdf",
