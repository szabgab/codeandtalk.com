    "description": "ClojureBridge are fun, free and, welcoming workshops for learning programing and getting started with Clojure for groups of people that aren't well represented in our sector. Many workshops have been held around the world, including Europe. They inspire people to realize tech or art projects or switch careers. The Berlin chapter is especially active, with a workshop happening every six months. We love to share some of our experiences, both the challenges and the successes.",
