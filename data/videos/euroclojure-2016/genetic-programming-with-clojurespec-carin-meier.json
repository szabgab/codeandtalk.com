    "description": "**Please note that video of Carin is absent until 6:15**\n\nClojure.spec allows us to generate test data based on our specifications. But what about generating a clojure.spec program based off of data? With genetic programming, we\u2019ll explore creating clojure.spec creatures that consume data for food. Then, we\u2019ll breed, mutate, and evolve them until we have a perfect fitting spec for our data. Finally, we'll take a step back and think about how clojure.spec gives us the ability to have our programs describe themselves and what that means to AI and self-repairing code.",
