    "description": "Pagination is an all-but ubiquitous element of UI design, yet you may find yourself re-inventing a pagination solution with each new Angular project. Faced with this problem, I wanted something I could drop in to any project, which would be as simple and intuitive as \"\"ng-repeat with page links\"\". I'll demonstrate my solution which makes powerful, flexible pagination as simple as adding a couple of lines to your HTML, with *no* extra code needed in your controller.\nYes, pagination is not exciting or cool, but you *will* need to use it, and this may make your life much simpler!\n\n(The module in question can be found at https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination)\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/michlbrmly",
