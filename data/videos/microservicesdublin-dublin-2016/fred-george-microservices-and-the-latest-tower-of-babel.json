    "description": "How can something so new sound like so many different things to different people? In this talk, we expose the broad range of things being called \"micro-services\". Some are small; some are not so small.\n\nWe will further suggest the battle over the term has already been lost. The drive to \"conform\" to the latest tech craze is too great to put the genie back in the bottle.  \n\nFinally, we propose a simple taxonomy to characterize what each of us means when we use the term to show the common ground we share, and plot some of the experiences of the presenter in this framework.",
