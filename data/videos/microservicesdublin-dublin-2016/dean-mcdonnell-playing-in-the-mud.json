    "description": "Microservices and microservice systems are at their best when they are flexible and easy to modify. This talk looks at a complete microservice system. It will show it running and demonstrate adding live monitoring as a set of additional microservices. Throughout we will discuss lessons learned and when it makes sense to build little balls of mud. \n\nAbout the speaker:\nDean is self taught software engineer who cut his teeth on .Net and Microsoft orientated technologies.
