    "description": "In this talk a vision is presented for the future of large scale distributed software development and deployment that is based on mirrored simulation of software execution behaviour (motion) and its environment (state) for reinterpretation and augmentation across space and time. When fully realized across multiple languages and platforms this vision has the potential to be a significant advancement in the engineering of software systems. \n\nThe talk will touch on the following topics which have inspired this approach \n\n-activity theory \n-mirror neurons and simulated embodiment \n-simulation theory (and the matrix) \n-multiverses \n-episodic memories and dreams \n\nas well as indirectly \n\n-discrete event simulation \n-actor programming model \n-supervision and control \n-signals and boundaries \n\nThis talk offers a model of human and software understanding based on activities actioned by actors within an environment supporting observation and perception of such acts including the situational context surrounding them, both before and after. The model is used to capture software behavior that is then streamed and mirrored into a Machine Matrix in which extensions, adaptations and augmentations are applied post execution as playback of behavior is simulated across 1000s of threads and processes.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nA renowned software engineer with particular expertise in self adaptive software runtimes, adaptive control, self-regulation, resilience engineering, information visualization, software simulation & mirroring as well as performance measurement and optimization.",
