    "description": "David will talk about the circuit breaker pattern, and especially about the project he's working on for nearForm, called Visigoth.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nDavid likes building stuff. Mainly software stuff. He has spent half of his life playing with money and computers around fintech learning from the pain points of a growing company. He loves food (who doesn't?) and cycling as much as walking with his dogs on the beach. He is also writing a book about how to build microservices using Node.js",
