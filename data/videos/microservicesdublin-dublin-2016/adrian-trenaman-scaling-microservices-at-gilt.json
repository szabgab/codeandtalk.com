    "description": "The ecommerce company Gilt.com (founded 2007) started out as a monolithic Rails application built and maintained by just a handful of engineers. Gilt has since become a global e-commerce destination built upon a sophisticated Scala/Java micro-services architecture strong enough to handle the company\u2019s intense traffic spikes--generated by millions of the company\u2019s members simultaneously visiting the site at noon each day. The concept of micro-services--smaller, lighter, faster components delivered swiftly to production--has resolved many of the growing pains we experienced evolving from \u201cjust a handful of engineers\u201d into an engineering team of +100. However, microservices bring their own set of tradeoffs. \n\nIn this talk I'll discuss the evolution of Gilt's micro-service architecture, and the challenges we now face today. How do you move a large Micro-Service deployment to the cloud? How does micro-services affect ownership and software quality? Why do API\u2019s really matter? How can the micro-service approach applied to front-end web applications? And, why has our adoption of micro-services lead us to the conclusion that all our teams should prefer to deploy and test software in production? \n\nAbout the speaker: \nAdrian Trenaman is the  VP Engineering at Gilt.
