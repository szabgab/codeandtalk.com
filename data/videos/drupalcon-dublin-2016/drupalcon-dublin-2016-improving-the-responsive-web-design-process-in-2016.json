    "description": "It's been 6 years since the term Responsive Web Design (RWD) was coined and today is difficult to see new projects without implementing it. But this time has allowed us to see the implementation can be even more important than the technique and the theory.\n\nThe RWD covers from the performance to the implementation of patterns and \"standard\" behaviors to improve usability.\n\nIn this session I will review tools, techniques and concepts to improve our projects:\n\nModern Design processes\nPerformance\nCSS structuring and optimization (CSS Methodologies and Living Styleguides)\nFixed-pixel vs relative units (and Viewport Sized Units)\nResponsive Typography and FOUT, FOIT\nImages, Responsive images and SVGs\nAsynchronous loading\nProxy-based browsers\nBeyond the Mouse\nRWD patterns and Progressively Disclosure\nI will show simulations for a better understanding.\n\nThis session is aimed to anyone who wants to improve his RWD knowledge, although a minimal RWD knowledge is expected. If you have the basics of RWD but have not gone much farther, this session will help you see the effects of a poor implementation. If the RWD is already your day-to-day, you might leave with interesting ideas to improve your projects.",
