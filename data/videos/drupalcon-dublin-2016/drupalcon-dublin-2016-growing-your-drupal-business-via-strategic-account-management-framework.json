Primary work focus has been the business practice around Drupal Stack, including but not limited to practice development, delivery excellence, solution consulting, sales and business development, and nurturing and growing existing accounts of Axelerant\u2019s partners & clients.\n\nI love contributing to the Drupal ecosystem ( non code most of the time ) by evangelizing, organizing, speaking and supporting various events like Drupalcons, Camps, Meetups etc. Having started my first such involvement by participating in Drupal.org Redesign Initiative of 2010 via testing activities.\n\nI live in Jaipur, India with my family. I\u2019ve been known to escape from work by watching movies ( preferably WWII genre ), networking & participating in local entrepreneurial groups & startup forums as well as catching up with friends.",
