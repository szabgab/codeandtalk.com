    "description": "We work with HTTP every day but really understanding how it works will level up your development skillset. \u00a0This session will fill in everything you need to know about HTTP whether you are making websites, integrating with APIs, or interacting with anything else with a web interface (such as CouchDB or the Internet of Things). \u00a0We will cover some theory with headers, verbs and also look at common authentication methods, all with real-world examples. \u00a0We will also introduce tools and techniques that will help you to develop more effectively when working with data types such as JSON and to handle systems built from or consuming many different services. \u00a0Developers and architects alike will benefit from this session packed with a mix of theory and practical tips.",
