    "description": "The attendees will need to have a decent grasp on\u00a0Object Oriented programming\u00a0and need to have heard of Domain-Driven Design.\n\nThey'll walk away with more knowledge about their application state and a concept called Event\u00a0Sourcing (ES). What is means to persist to the database without ES. When to use ES, but especially when not\u00a0to use it. The concept is easy to understand, but the implementation details and possible rammifications of using it in the wrong places are pretty devastating.\u00a0A good guide in the early\u00a0phases of learning this concept is hugely important.\n\nI'll give them the tools to get started,\u00a0guidelines to follow and what to look for when they start implementing ES.",
