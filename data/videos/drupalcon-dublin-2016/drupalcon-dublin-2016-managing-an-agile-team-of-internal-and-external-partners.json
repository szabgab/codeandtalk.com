    "description": "Managing an agile team is one thing when you're all part of the same organisation, so how do you manage a hyper-creative, cross-functional team made up of partners from many various agencies?\n\nOur make-up is quite unique: we are an in-house product team and two procured agencies.\u00a0\n\nWe have a brand team that owns the vision for the product, manages on-the-ground delivery, and supports and trains users on the front line; a Drupal consulting agency procured part-time to lead on technology and agile transformation; and a separate agency of developers (in-house and outsourced) with dedicated Scrum Master.\u00a0\n\nWe're a team of around 8 core people working to design, build and test product iterations for the Investors in People online suite (https://www.investorsinpeople.com/).\u00a0\n\nThis presentation will take you through the steps we have faced in applying agile principles in our context, including a look at the successes, the failures, the pitfalls and the many opportunities. Some of the topics we will cover are:\n\nAlignment: collaborating on one shared goal.\nCommunication: communicating the product vision to external developers (PO); bringing multiple parties together in line with one sprint goal (SM); communicating product developments and value back to the business (PO).\nProduct delivery: managing an in-life product, iterative releases and a large user base.\nOrganisational shift: championing the value of agile to the wider Investors in People business and promoting culture shift.",
