React components makes it extremely simple to create isolated components that can be plugged together to build large scale applications. Itâ€™s component model is a great fit to model data on a webpage which is typical of a content management system. The one-way data flow helps in modelling the page directly to data received from Drupal's RESTful API and is easy to comprehend compared to conventional MVC frameworks.\n\nIn this hands-on session, you will learn how to build a decoupled website using React ecosystem on the front-end and Drupal 8 as the content management system and a data source.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nHow to configure Drupal to expose RESTful resources using Drupal 8\n\nEnable CORS support for the domains/port running our React application\n\nAuthenticate requests using JWT\n\nConsume data on front-end using Redux store\n\nPass data from Redux store React components\n\n\n\nBy the end of this session, you will be able to:\n\nBuild a RESTful API using Drupal 8\n\nUse any backend with React front-end\n\n\nThis session is for Drupalers who know advanced JavaScript (functional programming skills are not required) and who are familiar with the React landscape.",
