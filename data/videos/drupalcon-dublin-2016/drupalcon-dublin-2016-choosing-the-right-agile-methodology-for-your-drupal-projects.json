    "description": "If Agile is an umbrella of methodologies, which one should you pick? The Agile Manifesto says that: individuals and interactions come before processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.\n\nBut while every Agile methodology follows iterative and incremental delivery, the execution processes and artifacts produced are very different.\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nThis session will explore and compare different Agile methodologies and share tips on how to choose the right one so you can accelerate your Drupal project. In the process, we will also discuss effective use of CYNEFIN (a popular decision making framework) to differentiate between Drupal projects and picking right agile methodologies for the same. Each insight will be backed by clear, real world examples from our projects. We’ll cover:\n\n\n\nScrum\n\nExtreme Programming\n\nFeature Driven Development\n\nScrumban\n\nKanban\n\nLean Development\n\n\nYou’ll walk away with\n\nA clearer idea of which methodology is right for each project, with project size, team size, iteration length, roles and responsibilities, distributed team support, risk mitigation level, customer interaction, taken into consideration.",
