    "description": "Life can drag you down, suck you into a black hole of constant doom and gloom, knock you sideways and - before you\u2019ve even had chance to find your feet again \u2013 whack you round the face with a big fat pile of fresh turd. This session is for anyone who wants to take a little more control of their life.\n\nI've come up with a list of life hacks \u2013 using therapeutic techniques, books and apps - which have helped me find myself again, to grow as a person, and to be more at ease with myself and the world around me. No matter what it throws at me, mostly.\n\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong when it comes to what will work for you, and sometimes it\u2019s a case of trial and error. But it's important to know there are tools out there which might make your life better, and I\u2019d love to share what I\u2019ve learned so far. There will also be some on-the-spot, in-your-seat, practical activities to participate in. \u00a0\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be facing a major stressful event to get something out of this. Anyone from any background, with any skillset or experience level should be able to take something away from the session. Whether it's comfort that you're not alone, a book or two to read, or a whole new \"I can do this, I am important\" mindset, I'm hopeful everyone will leave the session with a smile on their face and a spring in their step.",
