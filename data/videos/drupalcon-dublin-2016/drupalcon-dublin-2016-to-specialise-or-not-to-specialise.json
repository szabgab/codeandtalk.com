    "description": "Specialising or broadening your services are often presented as a choice: you can have one or the other. But why can’t they coexist within your Drupal agency?\n\nMichel van Velde is co-founder of One Shoe, one of the biggest integrated advertising and digital agencies in the Netherlands. From day one, his agency combines services as advertising (campaigns), strategy, UX, design, web development (Drupal, Laravel) and mobile development to provide unified solutions to clients.\n\nWhy did he make that decision and what is the added value? How did he keep focus in the last ten years? Why should you (not) only offer Drupal web development to your services?\n\nIn this presentation Michel van Velde shares insights on why, when and how you should consider diversifying your business.",
