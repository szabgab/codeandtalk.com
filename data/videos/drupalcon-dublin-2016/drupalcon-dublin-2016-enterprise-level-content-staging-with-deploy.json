    "description": "Through Drupal 6, Drupal 7, and now Drupal 8, the Deploy module has been the best way to stage content between different environments.\n\nThe Drupal 8 version of Deploy is vastly different before with a bunch of many optional dependencies that make it a flexible solution for all content staging needs.\n\nIn this session we will look at how you can use Deploy to manage and stage content between all your development, testing, staging, review, and live environments. What's even better is these environments can all be on the same site by making use of workspaces, or they can be different versions of the site, on different servers, in different data centres, from different hosting companies.\n\nMany of the underlying elements of Deploy are moving into core as part of the Workflow Initiative, this session will not delve into that but it will look from a site builders point of view on how to configure and use these tools.",
