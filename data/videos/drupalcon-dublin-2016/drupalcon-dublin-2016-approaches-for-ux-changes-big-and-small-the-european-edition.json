    "description": "Turning Drupal outside-in is a big focus for Drupal 8 and 9. We want to get better at making Drupal work just like people expect things to work.\n\nLets talk about what it means to design and build better Drupal UX.\n\nWhat to work on: how to prioritise and/or sequence efforts so we can be most effective\nHow to organise the work: “proces” for designing & building\nWhat we're actively working on now in the big initiatives as well as the more incremental tweaks\nWhat still needs figuring out: what are the blockers, how to remove those.\nA first version of this talk was presented at Drupalcon New Orleans. We'll have a look at what we've learned so far in getting more UX work done (we did!) and what we can do to get even more done, faster.",
