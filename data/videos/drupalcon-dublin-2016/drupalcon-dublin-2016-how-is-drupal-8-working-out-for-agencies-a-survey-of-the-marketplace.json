    "description": "As Dries highlighted in the keynote at Drupalcon Barcelona there is a natural dip in uptake of Drupal as we near a new version. In Dublin in late September we will nearly be 1 year since the official launch so how is\u00a0the market finding the uptake of Drupal?\n\nIn this session I will report back on a survey I am carrying out with the leading Drupal agencies globally. Questions focus on the uptake of Drupal, agencies experiences of working with it, typical project budget sizes for D8 builds, etc. The aim is to give us all a qualitative view of where we stand with the uptake and use of D8.\n\nAre there any challenges that remain in driving the uptake and, if so, what can we do to remove them?\n\nThis session is aimed at agency directors who want a commercial view of D8 and how its going with the 'competition'.",
