    "description": "Okay, you've made the move to containers and can now write Dockerfiles for everything. How do you manage all of those containers?. Have you found that you traded managing individual machines for managing individual containers?\n\nKubernetes (http://kubernetes.io), an Open Source container orchestration engine, can be your answer. We'll explore Kubernetes and see how you can use it to run massive collections of containers that fix their own problems and allow you to move your setup wherever you need to be. We'll also see how it's possible to create Drupal environments in Kubernetes using Drupal Dockerfiles.\n\nThis is a\u00a0beginner to advanced talk that gets tailored to the audience. It started with an\u00a0introduction to\u00a0\u00a0containers then\u00a0explands to\u00a0the next steps you need to take to start working with\u00a0containers. In the begining we'll level set to make sure that everybody is able to get something out of this session. \u00a0When the session is over attendees with walk away understanding of containers are the right technology for them, and how they can use them in production.",
