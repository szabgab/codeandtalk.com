    "description": "In this presentation you will see how you can utilize the\u00a0newest Jenkins 2 Pipelines to implement Continuous Integration/Deployment/Delivery for the Drupal site while respecting principles like Infrastructure As Code, Configuration As Code, DRY (Don\u2019t repeat yourself) and Open/Closed principle (from SOLID principles).\n\nAdyax already delivered\u00a0several site factories based on this system\u00a0and we\u00a0want to share with you the knowledge and the results.\n\nYou will see the whole process:\n\npushing a commit into self-hosted (Gitlab) or private Github repo;\nbuilding the docroot from the several sources;\nperforming deploy procedures, including drush updb, drush config-import, drush cache-rebuild, etc.\nperforming auto-tests (on the example of Behat) on servers (example will be performed on Acquia hosting platform)\nand everything will be in the same Pipeline configured as separate stages. \u00a0\n\nYou can have the universal reusable solution for your project that just needs to be configured for the specific project requirements.\n\nSome of the features that will be shown during presentation:\n\nAuto-generation of deploy pipelines\u00a0for each branch/state (e.g. Development, Staging, Production) configured.\nUtilizing different\u00a0approaches to managing\u00a0code structure such as Composer-based workflow and \u201call-code-in-repo\u201d solution in the same docroot.\nAuto-checking that code was actually delivered to the\u00a0server before starting drush deploy procedures and testing (very useful for platforms like Acquia where the\u00a0code is delivered to the server after pushing into Acquia Git with some delay).\nUniversal deploy script that can be used for any projects.\nAdditional project-specific deploy scripts that can extend - DRY (or override) basic deploy script - useful when you should delegate this part of the responsibility to another team, and you can even control what drush commands (not limited to drush-only) or command options can be used for the specific projects! In other words - project team can own\u00a0their deploy scripts.\nConfiguration as a code on Jenkins side:\u00a0All Jenkins jobs (pipelines) will be stored as code in Git and will be re-generated on Jenkins side in case of code changes with the help of Job DSL plugin.\nConfiguration as a code on Drupal side:\u00a0Every configuration change for Drupal should be performed in code and then processed on Dev, Stage, Prod servers during code deploys.\nHow to auto create URLs and databases on hosting platform (with Acquia as an example) based on your multisite setup in code.\nHow to perform automatic backups before code deploys (for example on Production).\nHow to copy whole sites (including files and DB) inside docroot or between different docroots with one click!\nHow to add custom actions to provide any additional functionality specific for your projects.\nAnd much more.\nEvery listed feature is a part of code package that will be presented.\n\nAlso, you will see many other features & tricks with Jenkins that can help you to implement your own specific workflows.\n\nNote: Jenkins 2 Pipeline formerly was known as Workflow\u00a0plugin for Jenkins.",
