    "description": "How do we accomplish a task? How can we learn from each other? What makes us effective?\n\nSince 2008, I have been able to work & grow together with an outstanding crowd of people. The Drupal community is an incredible diverse, international and enthusiastic collaborative space that I enjoy working with since day 1.\n\nIn this session, I\u2019d like to share my personal story about trial and error with leadership in the Drupal community and at work. We often think that solving problems ourselves is the right way to approach a problem - I more and more try to help others solve their problems.\n\nOver the last years I have found my way to grow together with the community in various roles: Being a presenter at DrupalCamps around the globe, being a site builder in Central America; a developer and community manager at epiqo & drunomics; an active community member and DrupalCamp organizer with Drupal Austria and a tech lead at Amazee Labs in Zurich.\n\nLetting go and not doing everything by yourself can be really difficult at times, but being a community and colleagues at work, I strongly believe it\u2019s the only way we can move forward together. Join me, if you are interested in hearing about my story of letting others help me, my selfish way of empowering others.",
