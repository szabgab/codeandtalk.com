    "description": "During the development cycle of Drupal 8, design best practices have changed drastically. This makes the initial installation of Drupal 8 look outdated. Additionally, users who know Drupal 7 see (almost) no visual change when moving to Drupal 8. Finally, best practices used in Drupal theming have changed.\n\nTo better communicate the possibilities Drupal provides for designers, we have proposed an initiative to design and develop a new theme to Drupal core: Create new user facing theme.\n\nAt this core conversation we will give an overview of what has happened so far, create a plan how the new theme should be designed, themed and added to core, and discuss how to keep Drupal look and feel up-to-date in future.",
