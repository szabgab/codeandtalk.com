The demand for Drupal is good news for us. For now. For most clients we may fix needs for a CMS and other functional solutions. But many clients have deeper, underlaying challenges that may tear at the fabric of that solid Drupal pipeline. While you may have a Drupal sponsor within your client's organisation, the business side within that organisation is steadily maturing and will be demanding help with bootstrapping their organisation towards online revenue and measurable return on investment. They will be asking you about digitally transforming their online precense and work in line with their online strategy. If not, you may start building up a network around you with wich to combine forces to help clients in their next step, beyond the requirements and choice for some specific CMS.\n\nIn this session I will share insights and experience of client-service optimization and how to win the hearts-and-minds of organisations that are progressing in their digital maturity and requiring Service Design.
