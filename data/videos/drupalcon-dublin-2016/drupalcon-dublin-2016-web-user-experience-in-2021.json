    "description": "The way people experience the web\u00a0will see dramatic change in response to new tools, expectations and constraints in the coming years. This session will highlight some major forces shaping our medium and lead us in thinking about how we should expect to evolve what we deliver\u00a0in light of changes in hardware, mobile, wearable, data, and software among others. We will look to parallels in architecture, aircraft\u00a0and other technologies\u00a0and suggest\u00a0future\u00a0trends that will evolve. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of the changing nature of our environment and the impact of all of these forces and is appropriate for anyone working in this field who is interested in what the future may bring.\u00a0Attendees\u00a0will leave ready to make their own decisions about how best to embrace these forces in their own work. \u00a0\n\nThis session will extend and improve\u00a0the Web User Experience in 2020\u00a0session given at DrupalCon New Orleans.",
