    "description": "Synopsis for Fastly Showcase Session:\n\nWe all know that performance is critical for any site, and Drupal is no exception. Â CDNs are known for improving performance, but did you know that they also play a significant role in maintaining uptime, providing security and can even serve content to your users during outages?\n\nWe have put together a panel to answer your questions around performance, security, uptime and any other related topics of interest.\n\nBy leveraging key features such as instant purging, request collapsing, and origin shield, the Drupal.org sites and services significantly reduced origin load.\n\n\nPANEL:\n\nDavid Strauss, CTO | Pantheon\nRudy Grigar, Infrastructure Manager | Drupal Association\nLeon Brocard, Sales Engineer | Fastly",
