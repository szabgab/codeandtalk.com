    "description": "A hands on Drupal8 Theming Twig extravaganza\u00a0\n\nTheming in Drupal8 was a massive shift from phptemplate to twig, but its more than changing the syntax. We changed the way of thinking about Drupal theming. Drupal twig theming is easy to learn, powerful, flexible and overall as awesome as warm coffee on a rainy day.
