    "description": "At Drupalcon Barcelona\u00a0Lukas Smith an I, Tonio Zemp, presented the way of the company Liip AG (150 people all in\u00a0Switzerland) into the self managed and \"Teal\" world (Self-Managing Organizations: Teal is the new Orange).\n\nWe described back then that we figured out beeing a nearly management-less company and are eager to reach a Teal evolution. At the end of the talk we discussed the pro`s and con`s of evolving our\u00a0own organizational model or take something\u00a0\"of the shelf\", namely\u00a0Holacracy.\n\nWe received a lot of\u00a0great feedback and quite some buzz around that talk.\n\nNow, nearly a year later a lot of things happened. Did go with Holacracy, we officially removed the management positions, we had great successes and great frustrations. We want to be open and\u00a0share a honest picture of our experience the past year.\n\nWe think that these insights will proof very helpful for agencies facing the \"Going for Growth\" topic.\n\nTo reach a broder audience the talk will\u00a0recap what happened before Drupalcon Barcelona, and give a short introduction into the topic of self managing organizations before the deepdive into our experience of the past year.\n\nSo\u00a0a \"beginner\" will get at least a first eye-opening experience and some entertainment, an \"intermediate\" (already read about the topic, maybe attended\u00a0the talk a year ago) gets encouraged to go this way while an \"expert\" (working on the same topic) gets valuable insight in real world problems and solutions.",
