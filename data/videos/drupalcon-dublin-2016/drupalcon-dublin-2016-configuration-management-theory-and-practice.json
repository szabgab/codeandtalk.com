    "description": "Configuration Management is one of the revolutionary features in Drupal 8. It is a life-changing opportunity for site builders, who can get rid of the database-based workflow at last. But it has significant implications for developers too. \n\nDevelopers often want to use Configuration Management outside its intended use case. New workflows and practices have to be established. We'll see some examples from real projects, and outline a list of possible future improvements that can make Configuration Management better suitable for the developers' needs.\n\nAttendees are expected to be familiar with basic site-building processes, and they will walk away with a gallery of real examples where Configuration Management shows its limits and additional modules or best practices step in for a smooth development experience.",
