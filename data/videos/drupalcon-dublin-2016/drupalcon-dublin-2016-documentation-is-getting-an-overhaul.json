    "description": "Having high-quality documentation available for Drupal.org is key to gaining wider adoption, growing the community, and the overall success of the Drupal project. I want to share the work related to documentation going on in the community, as well as some of our plans for continued improvement in the future.\n\nThe community, the Drupal Association, and the Documentation Working Group have all been hard at work improving both the processes and the tools we all use to manage our documentation. And we\u2019re making huge progress! By the time DrupalCon happens much of this work will already be in use on Drupal.org.\u00a0This session is for anyone who wants to learn about these changes, and what to expect in the future.\n\nIn this session I want to share the progress being made on various initiatives. I\u2019ll start by discussing some of the pain-points that have been identified, and look at how the conversation has evolved over the last couple of years, and then I\u2019ll share information about the following initiatives that are addressing these pain-points:\n\nThe Drupal 8 user manual initiative\nDocumentation sections and section maintainers\nUpdates to Drupal.org tools and information architecture that make documentation pages easier to maintain, and how to use them\nUngoing changes to Drupal.org that facilitate better collaboration, and maintainership of documentation pages\nFinally, I would like to make sure there is time left at the end of the session for others to share their ideas about how documentation could be further improved and to provide feedback on recent and proposed changes.",
