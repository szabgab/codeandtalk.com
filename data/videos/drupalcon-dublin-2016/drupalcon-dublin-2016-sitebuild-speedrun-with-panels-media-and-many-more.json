    "description": "The concept of our speedrun is that we will demonstrate the intricacies of building a ridiculously awesome Drupal 8 site live. We will have senior developers working live on theming, site building and functional coding in parallel with an accompanying slide deck and live commentary.\n\nWe will base our speedrun on a pre-specified set of functional requirements and a design. The broad concept is a product launch site with social feeds, CRM connected lead capture forms, authoring workflows for content marketers and campaign specific landing pages.\n\nSpeedrun live tasks:\n\nDevelop a brand specific theme based on bootstrap using a css styleguide\nConfigure a content approval workflow for content marketers and editors\nConfigure new panelizer layouts and set defaults for editors\nCreate views-based social feed pages, with curation based on a taxonomy\nCreate animated, long-scroll landing pages using panels\nConfigure and connect contact forms to a CRM",
