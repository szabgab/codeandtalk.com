    "description": "Don’t let your process lead you down the road to ruin, trust your instincts.  As a generally intuitive person, I’ll talk about some of the more soft skills you can develop to ensure you can manage your project to success.\n\nMetrics, spreadsheets, the latest and greatest agile tools are all incredible parts of getting projects done in this day and age, yet the softer skills that come from our intuitive or gut can often be just as critical in ensuring a project goes well.\n\nSince I’ve worked in the Drupal space for almost 10 years, I’ll also be touching on some tactical intuitive tips that I’ve learned along the way including some common patterns in Drupal projects that I’ve learned to recognize early on through a combination of experience and intuition.  I’ll also focus on a helpful framework of the four types of ‘problems’: ‘internet level’, ‘system level’, ‘business level, and ‘people level’ that can be encountered and solution strategies that bridge your intuition with actionable steps to move the project forward.\n\nWhile there won’t be milk and cookies, I’ll teach you the value of actually having milk and cookies at your next project meeting, and I’ll be bringing my crystal ball.",
