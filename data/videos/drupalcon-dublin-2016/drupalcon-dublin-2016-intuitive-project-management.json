    "description": "Don\u2019t let your process lead you down the road to ruin, trust your instincts. \u00a0As a generally intuitive person, I\u2019ll talk about some of the more soft skills you can develop to ensure you can manage your project to success.\n\nMetrics, spreadsheets, the latest and greatest agile tools are all incredible parts of getting projects done in this day and age, yet the softer skills that come from our intuitive or gut can often be just as critical in ensuring a project goes well.\n\nSince I\u2019ve worked in the Drupal space for almost 10 years, I\u2019ll also be touching on some tactical intuitive tips that I\u2019ve learned along the way including some common patterns in Drupal projects that I\u2019ve learned to recognize early on through a combination of experience and intuition. \u00a0I\u2019ll also focus on a helpful framework of the four types of \u2018problems\u2019: \u2018internet level\u2019, \u2018system level\u2019, \u2018business level, and \u2018people level\u2019 that can be encountered and solution strategies that bridge your intuition with actionable steps to move the project forward.\n\nWhile there won\u2019t be milk and cookies, I\u2019ll teach you the value of actually having milk and cookies at your next project meeting, and I\u2019ll be bringing my crystal ball.",
