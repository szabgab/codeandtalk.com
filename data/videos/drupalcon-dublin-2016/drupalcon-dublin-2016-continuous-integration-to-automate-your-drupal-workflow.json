    "description": "Are you still catching yourself manually doing configuration work upon deploying your code to production? Or quickly having to perform a rollback because of an unpredicted side effect or bug? And does deploying your code still eat away precious development time?\n\nIf the answer to either of these questions is yes, then this session will definitely yield new insights to your development & deployment process and strategy. Through the introduction of continuous integration and automated deployments, you can cut down on development time, while giving an enormous boost to the quality and consistency of your code.\n\nWithin this talk, I will lay out the required tools and concepts to get you and your team up and running with continuous integration and automated deployments for your Drupal projects.\n\nI will present a peek into a better development and deployment flow through the conception of a feature request, all the way through its release to production.\n\nThrough this journey, I will touch on many DevOps techniques and tools, such as Vagrant & container virtualization with Docker, task runners such as Grunt, merge request catalyst GitLab & GitLab CI, automated code testing tools and much more.\n\nEven if you're already familiar with CI, you will take home at least one new insight or tool that will aid in a better development practice.",
