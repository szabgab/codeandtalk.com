    "description": "Agile project management emphasizes working in small, manageable chunks. Teams should identify their goals and then constantly re-evaluate their progress and direction. Oddly, many agencies attempt one giant leap to switch themselves to processes that are all about baby steps. This session will suggest that web agencies think of their own project teams as the product on which they are iterating. What is the Minimum Viable Product for a team at your agency using Agile techniques? Answering that question requires thinking about the purpose of each Agile practice and how it would fit into your agency. This session will include:\n\nAn overview of different Agile practices, including daily stand ups, retrospectives, task boards, demos, backlog grooming and Behavior-Driven Development.\nAn explanation of the benefits each of these practices is intended to provide.\nPractical examples for how to start using just a bit more Agile in your workplace.\nDiscussion of the pitfalls agencies often find when adopting Agile.",
