    "description": "In this session a SCRUM master, Evelien Schut, and a business owner, Mieszko Czyzyk, share the lessons learned from transitioning to multidisciplinary, fixed teams within the agency model.\n\nThese insights are based on our experience at GoalGorilla, a 25 people Drupal agency based in the Netherlands. They transitioned over a period of several months from a more traditional department structure working on \u2018projects\u2019 to a fixed team structure working for clients and building and maintaining products.\n\nThis talk is interesting for SCRUM masters and project managers looking for tips on common challenges such as:\n\norganizing the roles of team members, for example product owners and other non-developers such as designers\nmanaging agile sprints for different customers, with one team.\u00a0\ntime and billable rate reporting\nfacilitating a distributed team across timezones\nFor business owners this talk is interesting because it touches upon:\n\nreal world business metrics such as billable rates and turnover per full-time employee\na vision how this team structure supports a culture of shared responsibility, collaboration and professional excellence\na vision how this team structure supports a path for sustainable agency growth, with reduced risk\u00a0\nThe last 10 minutes are reserved for discussion on an\u00a0aspect\u00a0that proves to be especially challenging:\n\nintegrating sales into the teams instead, of more traditionally, account managers or directors",
