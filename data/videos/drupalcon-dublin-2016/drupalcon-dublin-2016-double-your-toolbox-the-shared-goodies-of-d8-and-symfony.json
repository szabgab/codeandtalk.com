    "description": "You already know that Symfony and Drupal share a lot of things, but you might not know what that means... or how dangerous it's about to make you!\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at the fundamental principles behind Drupal 8, which happen to be the same things that drive Symfony behind the scenes. These include routes and controllers, events and the all-important service, service container and (queue dramatic sound-effect)Â dependency injection. If these concepts are still fairly new to you, this talk is for you: master them all at once and unlock a world where one skillset will empower you to use D8 or the Symfony framework should that need arise. It's a wonderful, new shared world: let's make something amazing, together.\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nicolasgrekas/double-your-toolbox-the-shared-goodies-of-d8-and-symfony",
