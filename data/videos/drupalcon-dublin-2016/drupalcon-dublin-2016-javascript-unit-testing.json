    "description": "Testing is an important practice in software development to improve software quality, and it can be precarious no matter what language you\u2019re in. The flexibility offered by JavaScript can make your tests powerful, but if you\u2019re not careful, that same flexibility can leave you frustrated. As Drupal gains more JavaScript developers we'll need to up our testing game.\n\nYou should be writing tests to inspire confidence that everything is working as expected. If something breaks, you want to be sure that you\u2019ll catch it and quickly understand what went wrong.\n\nWe'll go over some advanced JavaScript testing tools that will leave you less frustrated and help you hit your coverage goals, as well as put together an JavaScript testing essentials toolkit.\u00a0\n\nHere are some of the topics we'll cover,\n\nA quick introduction to JavaScript unit tests.\nStart writing asynchronous tests with AVA\nManaging coverage reports with NYC/Istanbul\nAutomating browser interaction testing with Nightmare.\nAutomating your tests with Travis\nWriting unit tests for both a new and existing project.\nMocking and stubbing API's and functions.",
