  "description": "The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS enables completely decentralized and distributed apps. And it now supports fully dynamic apps, like real-time chat! This talk breaks down how to build a dynamic app on top of IPFS with CRDTs, pub/sub, and slick UIs. It also delves into new models for distributed computation, and the ethical importance of distributing the web.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nJuan is the inventor of IPFS and Filecoin. He founded Protocol Labs, Inc., he loves open source, and believes improving the internet is critical work. Juan is obsessed with knowledge, science, and technology. He studied at Stanford, and the Web.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016",
