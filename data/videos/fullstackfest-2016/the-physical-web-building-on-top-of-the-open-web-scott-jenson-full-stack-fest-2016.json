As the web gets better, it makes the Physical Web look brilliant, but honestly, it's the web that's being awesome, the Physical Web is just getting a free ride. This talk will discuss some of the amazing concepts and future directions from the web community that are making the Physical Web look so promising.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nScott Jenson has been doing user interface design and strategic planning for over 25 years.
