  "description": "In this talk, we'll explore Elm, the programming language that brings an entirely new approach to front-end development. We'll study the language but, more importantly, the characteristics that make it such a great language to build reliable, robust client-side applications and how we can take these properties and apply them to JavaScript applications.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nJack is a JavaScript Developer at Songkick, based in London. He spends most of his time writing and talking about JavaScript and front end web development. He's the author of \"Beginning jQuery\" (Apress, 2013) and is currently focusing on ECMAScript 6, React and the state of tooling for web developers. If not at a computer he's usually found playing football or sat in the pub talking about code.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)",
