  "description": "As our applications grow larger, our REST architecture often becomes unmanageable. Custom endpoints and over/under fetching all become part of your life as a developer. Leave that behind and welcome GraphQL, a declarative and hierarchal way to fetch data, with just one endpoint to rule them all.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nA Jazz guitarist turned developer, Marc-Andr\u00e9 is currently working at Shopify, trying to make commerce better for everyone. When he's not hacking on Rails, GraphQL or Relay, he likes lifting heavy barbells above his head.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)",
