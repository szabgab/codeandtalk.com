    "description": "Modern systems can fail in spectacular ways. Failure isnâ€™t a question of if, but when. Resilient systems can endure and gracefully recover from failures, but ensuring your system has these properties requires thought and some deliberate architectural decisions. Join me in this talk as I attempt to find answers in literature and industry to build a more robust system. I will also share the lessons learned while applying these patterns and key takeaways that you can carry to your own systems.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nInes Sombra is an Engineer at @Fastly, where she spends her time helping the Web go faster. Ines holds an M.S. in Computology with an emphasis on Cheesy 80's Rock Ballads. She has a fondness for steak, fernet, and a pug named Gordo. In a previous life she was a Data Engineer.",
