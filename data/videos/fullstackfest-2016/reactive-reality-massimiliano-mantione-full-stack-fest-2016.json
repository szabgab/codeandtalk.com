  "description": "Building User Interfaces is hard. Building them in 3D worlds (virtual reality) is harder. Building them mixing 2D and 3D elements in a web browser is literally a technology frontier project. Doing it maintaining the API and developer friendliness of ReactJS... is what I'll show!\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nSoftware engineer, mostly interested in programming languages and compilers. Started as a Javascript hater but this changed after he worked in the V8 team in Google for about one year and half. Now, among other things, he is working on a virtual reality system for business events on the web: Hyperfair, transitioning it to WebGL and mobile platforms.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)",
