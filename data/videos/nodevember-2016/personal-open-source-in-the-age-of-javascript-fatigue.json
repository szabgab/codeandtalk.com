You share the code online and somehow people find and actually start using this module you wrote. Now what?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will discuss some things to do and things to avoid when managing a personal, open-source library. Additionally, we'll explore some ways that everyone, open-source contributor or not, can help promote a healthy and vibrant ecosystem.",
