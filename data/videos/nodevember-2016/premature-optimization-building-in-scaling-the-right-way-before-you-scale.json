With all the focus on properly designed apps it can be hard to tell when you're setting up good patterns or just over optimizing. Let's talk about some optimizations that save time from the start.\r\n\r\nThis talk is based on many years of experience of doing projects of varies sizes, and the commonalities between the small and the big, all which helped me to lead a time to create a platform that is combustable to handle thousands of requests a minute. \r\n\r\nSome things we'll cover are:\r\n\r\n- Dev-Ops optimizations\r\n- Release flow optimizations\r\n- Dependency management\r\n- Config management\r\n- Project Structure \r\n- Platform thinking vs App thinking\r\n- Services and when to use them\r\n\r\nYou should leave with some good ideas and ways to tell if you're optimizing prematurely or if you're setting up a foundation for rapid development.",
