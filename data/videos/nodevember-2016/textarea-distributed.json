    "description": "How hard can it be to make a `‹textarea›` that multiple users can edit at once?\r\n\r\nIn the first half of this talk, we'll show three simple, easy ways to implement a shared textarea, with code you can try out in your browser. What could go wrong?\r\n\r\nIn the second half, we'll do a postmortem on the first half. We'll watch some snail races, talk about relativity, dig into eventual consistency and CRDTs, and show how the shared textarea relates to problems you might have in your own app's back end. If we're really lucky, we might even edit some text together.",
