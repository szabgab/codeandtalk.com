    "description": "WTF is a graph database\r\n- Euler and Graph Theory\r\n- Math -- it's hard, let's skip it\r\n- It's about data -- lots of it\r\n- But let's zoom in and look at the basics\r\n## Relational model vs graph model\r\n- How do we represent THINGS in DBs\r\n- Relational vs Graph\r\n- Nodes and Relationships\r\n## Why use a graph over a relational DB or other NoSQL?\r\n- Very simple compared to RDBMS, and much more flexible\r\n - The real power is in relationship-focused data (most NoSQL dbs don't treat relationships as first-order)\r\n  - As related-ness and amount of data increases, so does advantage of Graph DBs\r\n - Much closer to our whiteboard model\r\n - Answering questions you didn't expect\r\n\r\n\r\n## Let's look at some examples\r\n* A bit o' live code\r\n* Based on OSMI mental health in tech survey graph\r\n\r\n## How do we use this from a programming lang?\r\n* Neo4j 3.x uses a RESTful API and a native protocol (BOLT)\r\n * All client libraries are wrappers for this\r\n * Show a couple code examples with popular wrappers\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n* Graph Story\r\n* OSMI Graph Blog\r\n* Neo4j docs\r\n\r\n# More Resources\r\n- http://neo4j.com/blog/7-ways-data-is-graph/",
