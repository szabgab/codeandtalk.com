    "description": "Jeff Barczewski\nhttp://nodevember.org/talk/Jeff%20Barczewski\nLike many of you, I was searching for the best way to build my JavaScript applications. How do I structure my code properly so my app can grow without being boxed in? I started experimenting to find the best approach to use for my Redux apps. There seemed to be a good sized gap between my ideal goals and the way others were doing things.\r\n\r\nWas I doing things wrong or just misunderstanding the ideas? I explored further by reading blog articles, questions and answer forums, github issues trying to gain all the knowledge I could. It seemed like I was still missing something. The solutions people were leading me to were either lacking in capabilities or the resulting code was much too complex for my liking.\r\n\r\nI wanted things to be simple and straight-forward so that any of my teammates could easily pick things up, understand, and be comfortable working with it. How could these solutions be the recommended ways to structure my code? Is there a better way?\r\n\r\nAfter finally grasping the essence of what I was looking for and taking inspiration from existing projects, I set out to build that small focused library. I wanted to see if it might be possible. It seemed reasonable on paper, but would it work?\r\n\r\nI share all the highlights of my journey and explain the simple inner workings of redux-logic. Everyone who attends will come out with a better understanding of business logic and how to apply it in Redux.",
