    "description": "It is the recognition that well-read is not a destination, there is nowhere to get to and if there was somewhere to get to, you would need a thousand years to even think about getting there.\" -Linda Holmes\r\n\r\nMany people strive to be \u201cwell-read\u201d as developers or designers, they want to know & do it all. But why? All in the name of being \u201cwell-read\u201d? All just to say \u201cYeah \u2014 I've done that\u201d?\r\n\r\nWhy do we do what we do? Why do we try so hard? Why are we here, paying to be here, to listen to people talk? Maybe because we\u2019re life long learners - we want to learn new things? Commune with our own kind? But why? Come examine our motives as developers, the pitfalls we fall into, and the cost of being great.",
