You\u2019ll learn what Dr. Roy Fielding\u2019s REST actually is, and why it might be time to move on to newer architectures. You\u2019ll learn a little about the JSON API specification and its relationship to REST. Then of course we\u2019ll take a deep dive into both Netflix\u2019s Falcor and Facebook\u2019s GraphQL\u2014their similarities, their differences, and their tradeoffs from an unbiased developer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session you\u2019ll get a practical recommendation of which API architecture to adopt for your next project, in addition to knowing the problems all modern API architectures still share with a vision of the future for our API architectures.\r\n\r\nAn API will always at the center of our apps from now into the foreseeable future. A healthy API will benefit a development team immensely, but a poor API will only cost development teams. Knowing your API architectures is an important first step so you can make the best decisions from the beginning.",
