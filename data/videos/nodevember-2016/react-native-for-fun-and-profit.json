    "description": "An introduction to react-native for web developers. Leave the browser behind and use your JS skills to interact with GPS, accelerometer, camera, and other hardware specific features. I'll cover the basics of native app development including components, platform code, touch events, testing, and deployment. I'll demo a couple of apps and show you how to control IoT devices from a React Native app.",
