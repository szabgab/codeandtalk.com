  "description": "Ready, set, launch, (...crickets...). The tale of many a developer-turned-product-launcher, including me. But after a false start, I launched Classroom 7, a learning management system for trainers, which is now well on its way to paying the bills. Bootstrapping a product requires a bit of a multiple personality disorder - you've got to be a dreamer, engineer, critic, bank manager and sales exec all rolled into one. In this talk I'll share some of the lessons I've learned during the product launching journey and talk about some of the pitfalls that should be avoided when launching a product. Everyone has the ability to bootstrap a successful product, you've just got to start out right. This talk will set you on the right path.",
