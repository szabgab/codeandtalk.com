    "description": "The Intel Galileo is a single board computer designed for makers and experimenters. Unlike the famous Raspberry Pi, the Galileo uses an Intel Quark processor and provides compatibility with the Arduino R3 from both a software and hardware (with pin compatibility for Arduino shields) perspective.\n\nThis presentation will look at some of the things that are possible with the Galileo using Java and Arduino hardware. Weâ€™ll use the Zulu binary distribution of the OpenJDK project from Azul and explore ways to communicate with the IO capabilities of the board. There will be plenty of fun demos to show the power of combining the Galileo with Java.",
