David will explain how Riot provides secure coding guidance to software engineers, works with QA, and maintains an application security community of practice. This talk will also include demonstrations of custom security tools we’ve developed to help our engineers produce secure code.\n\nThere are many options when it comes to understanding and improving an application security program.
