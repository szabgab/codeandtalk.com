    "description": "Many concepts from Extreme Programming are now widely accepted. It’s no longer unusual to find development teams practising Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration, Collective Ownership, and working in mall iterations. Meanwhile, the Extreme Programming community has moved on.\n\nExtreme Programming was described by Kent Beck as “take everything I know to be valuable about software engineering and turn the dials to 10” We’ll look at how some of the practices have evolved as teams turn the dials still further.\n\nI’ll give you a flavour of several practices of a modern extreme programming team including Mob Programming, Continuous Deployment, Monitoring-Driven-Development, and Products over Projects. You will see how they have have made us more effective, and also what some of the pitfalls have been.",
