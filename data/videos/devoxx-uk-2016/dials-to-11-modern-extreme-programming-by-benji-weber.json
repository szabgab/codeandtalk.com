  "description": "Many concepts from Extreme Programming are now widely accepted. It\u2019s no longer unusual to find development teams practising Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration, Collective Ownership, and working in mall iterations. Meanwhile, the Extreme Programming community has moved on.\n\nExtreme Programming was described by Kent Beck as \u201ctake everything I know to be valuable about software engineering and turn the dials to 10\u201d We\u2019ll look at how some of the practices have evolved as teams turn the dials still further.\n\nI\u2019ll give you a flavour of several practices of a modern extreme programming team including Mob Programming, Continuous Deployment, Monitoring-Driven-Development, and Products over Projects. You will see how they have have made us more effective, and also what some of the pitfalls have been.",
