    "description": "Microsoft is changing and wants to support developers using the languages, tools and platforms that they want to use. This session will take a look at the background to this change, including adoption and contribution to open source technologies such as Git & Linux, bringing the Bash shell to Windows, and more.\n\nWeâ€™ll also take a look at how Java developers are supported in the cloud with Microsoft Azure, the tooling integrations that Microsoft has made available and how Agile teams are supported with collaborative work tracking, private hosted git repos and cross-platform build and release tooling, all without leaving your preferred development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ and CodeEnvy.",
