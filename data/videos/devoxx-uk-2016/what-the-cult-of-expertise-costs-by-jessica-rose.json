    "description": "Experts, senior developers, thought leaders – software development is obsessed with the idea of expertise. As individuals we aim to present ourselves as experts while companies fight to employ visible experts and present their brand as most knowledgeable. This talk will examine the costs of our expert obsession, looking at how individual performance, experimentation and diversity within the industry are impacted. We’ll look at practical ways to succeed in the expertise race alongside subtle, useful ways to subvert the dynamic.",
