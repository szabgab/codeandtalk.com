    "description": "JavaScript in the enterprise? Does that even make sense? After years of developing Java applications in the enterprise, many developers have become curious about what JavaScript can do for them. But how can you translate concepts like 'modularity' and 'loose coupling' to JavaScript applications?\n\nDo JavaScript applications have these kinds of concepts? AngularJS is a popular solution in the JavaScript world, though there are many other solutions, too. In this session, you will be introduced to RequireJS, responsive JavaScript, mobile development with JavaScript, as well as JavaScript transpilers such as GWT, Vaadin, and DukeScript.\n\nBy the end of this session, you will have a thorough understanding of whether JavaScript is a sensible solution for you in developing enterprise JavaScript applications, today.",
