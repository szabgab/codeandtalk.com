  "description": "Releasing new product can be painful, risky, and time-consuming.\n\nAt Hotels.com we evolved processes and technical practices to achieve rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new user functionality. Automation of build, deployment and testing processes, and improved collaboration between product management, developers, test engineers and tech operations enabled a world of \u201cProduct Mind-set\u201d, where software can be released in hours, or even minutes. In this talk we\u2019ll analyse the technology and process changes that enabled us to move from quarterly release schedules to application and service releases on demand. Delivering fast requires new methods and new tools, and we have to have the courage to leave old tools behind.\n\nWe\u2019ll consider how positive change is achieved by constantly re-balancing investment in technology, process and people who drive the change.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll argue that increasing the pace of delivery is not enough. We\u2019ll discuss how Hotels.com focuses on improving the pace of finding out which issues are worthless, to reduce the delivery of features that won\u2019t add value to its customers.",
