    "description": "The Java 8 release takes Java to a whole new level. Learning the new features is just the first step. The real question is how to make best use of them. There won\u2019t be too much time in this session to introduce the new features, so you\u2019ll need to know what lambdas and method references are in advance. Instead, the focus will be on how coding in Java 8 differs to previous Java versions, and how to avoid going too far with the new goodies. Join me for an opinionated session of best practices.",
