    "description": "While we\u2019re drawing ever closer to Java 9, and even hearing about features in Java 10, it\u2019s also true that many of us are still working with an older version. Even if your project has technically adopted Java 8, and even if you\u2019re using it when coding new features, it\u2019s likely the majority of your code base is still not making the most of what\u2019s available in Java 8 - features like Lambda Expressions, the Streams API, and new Date/Time.\n\nIn this presentation, Trisha will:\n\nHighlight some of the benefits of using Java 8 - after all, you\u2019ll probably have to persuade The Management that tampering with existing code is worthwhile\n\nDemonstrate how to identify areas of code that can be updated to use Java 8 features\n\nShow how to automatically refactor your code to make use of features like lambdas and streams.\n\nCover some of the pros and cons of using the new features - including suggestions of when refactoring may NOT be the best idea.",
