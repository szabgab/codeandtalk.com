    "description": "Love it or hate it (and a lot of people seem to hate it), Maven is a widely used tool. We can consider that Maven has been the de-facto standard build tool for Java over the last 10 years. Most experienced developers already got their share of Maven headaches. Unfortunately, new developers are going through the same hard learning process, because they don't know how to deal with Maven particularities. \"Why is this jar in my build?\", \"I canâ€™t see my changes!\", \"The jar is not included in the distribution!\", \"The artifact was not found!\" are common problems. Learn to tame the Maven Beast and be in complete control of your build to save you countless hours of pain and frustration.",
