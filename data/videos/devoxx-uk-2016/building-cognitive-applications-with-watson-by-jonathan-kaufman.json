    "description": "The more we interact with “smart apps,” the more we hear the word “cognitive” being thrown around. But what actually does this imply? What is a cognitive application? Can I make my app smarter? Can I make my app cognitive? In this session we'll be covering what these buzzwords mean and how to enhance your application with Watson services. We'll build an application from scratch and we'll discuss how to integrate Watson into your existing application.\n\nWe will start with a demo of https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/election-insights which uses Alchemy for sentiment analysis and entity extraction along with visual recognition. That app is hosted here: http://electioninsights.mybluemix.net/#/. From there we will use Node-Red to quickly build an app that uses Watson Tone Analysis and translates tone into color.",
