    "description": "Over the past few years the software development industry has moved more virtual, decomposed into smaller services, automated most of its processes and focussed on eradicating any, and all, friction in the pursuit of continuous everything.\n\nSo what does the future hold?\n\nHow does Java and the JVM stack up against the cool kids on the block like Lambda and Azure Functions? What\u2019s next? \u201cno ops\u201d, \u201cserver less\u201d \u2026 \u201cdeveloper less\u201d?\n\nWe\u2019ll pose these questions to a panel of Devoxx UK Program Committee members, get their opinions about how we\u2019re moving forward, and start looking at what the future might hold for the working developer.",
