  "description": "Amazon Lambda is shaking-up Java server-side development. Now you can write services in the cloud without having to think about app servers or containers. This is revolutionary. This session will cover Amazon Lambda and some of the other services that will reduce the about of code and infrastructure you have to write and maintain. With Amazon Lambda you can write Java code and expose it as web services in the cloud or connect it to Amazon\u2019s high availability JMS service. Amazon\u2019s mantra is that everything in the cloud should be exposed as an API and we\u2019ll see how Lambda ties into Amazon\u2019s databases, VPCs, etc. I will also touch on how and where Java EE fits into this puzzle and whether you still need a container. This session provides an overview of the services available on AWS and best practices for Java developers.",
