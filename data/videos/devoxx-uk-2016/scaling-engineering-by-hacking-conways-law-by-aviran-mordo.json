    "description": "Working in a fast-growing company that doubles in size every year, maintaining the quality of products and engineers is a very challenging task.\n\nIn this talk I will describe how Wix corporate structure evolved from functional teams to gangs, cross-functional teams responsible for end-to-end delivery; guilds, professional groups responsible for methodology, best practices, and training; and mini-companies that serve as internal startups to support rapid growth while maintaining velocity. I will also discuss how we poured our culture into a game-like “guild day”, that helps us maintain alignment, keep the high quality of our work and people, share knowledge, recruit and preserve the best developers, and support a quality-based culture of innovation.",
