    "description": "Have fun writing books and tutorials using markdown and Gitbook, an Open Source app for generating a responsive website and ebook formats of your content.\n\nAll your content is written in markdown and you can run the app locally to get an instant view of your content as soon as you save. Gitbook uses CodeMirror, so your source code is very readable and Gitbook has many other tools to make your content easy to read.\n\nI'll also show you how to publish onto Github pages, giving a fast, highly scalable site for your content. You can also publish your books through Gitbook.io or self publish your content at numerous other sites.",
