    "description": "You know when a problem has you stuck, you Google\u2019d it, checked Stack Overflow and still can\u2019t find what you need?\n\nEarlier this year Voxxed connected with IBM, asking if Watson could help find technical answers differently. We wanted to look at Cognitive Search, hook it up to a library of videos and articles we\u2019ve published over the years, and try to make something better than what is already around.\n\nRecently we started hacking and want to share what we did - hopefully some of you will help take it further.\n\nWe\u2019ll walk you through the project so far, using Watson Speech to text and Concept Insights APIs to build a cognitive engine to find technical videos and articles in a corpus we\u2019ve created. And we\u2019ll ask whether Concept Insights helped us make better decisions when analyzing quantities of unstructured data.\n\nWe\u2019ve only scratched the surface. More tech, sources and ideas need to be plugged in, and we\u2019ll iterate between Devoxx conferences in different locations. Come and hear what we could do, what we\u2019ve managed so far, and how to get your hands on the code.\n\nSome of the Watson API\u2019s we\u2019ve been playing with are at: https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson.html",
