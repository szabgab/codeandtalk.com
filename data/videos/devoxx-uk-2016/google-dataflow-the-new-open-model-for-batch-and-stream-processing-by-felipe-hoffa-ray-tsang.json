  "description": "In 2004 Google published the MapReduce paper, a programming model that kick-started big data as we know it. Ten years later, Google introduced Dataflow - a new paradigm, integrating batch and stream processing in one common abstraction. This time the offer was more than a paper, but also an open source Java SDK and a cloud managed service to run it. In 2016 big data players like Cask, Cloudera, Data Artisans, PayPal, Slack, Talend joined Google to propose Dataflow for incubation at the Apache Software Foundation - Dataflow is here, not only unifying batch and streaming, but also the big data world.\n\nIn this talk we are going to review Dataflow's differentiating elements and why they matter. We\u2019ll demonstrate Dataflow\u2019s capabilities through a real-time demo with practical insights on how to manage and visualize streams of data.",
