    "description": "The process of building a pattern library or any kind of modular design system requires a different approach to delivering a set of finished pages. Even when the final deliverable is a pattern library, we often still have to design pages for approval. So, when everyone is so used to working with pages, it can be difficult to adopt a new way of thinking\u2014particularly for those who are not designers and developers.\nThis talk will look at how we can help everyone in the team adopt pattern thinking. This includes anyone with a decision to make\u2014not just designers and developers. The whole team can start developing a shared vocabulary and attempt to make the challenge of naming things a little easier.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2016/speakers/charlotte-jackson\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
