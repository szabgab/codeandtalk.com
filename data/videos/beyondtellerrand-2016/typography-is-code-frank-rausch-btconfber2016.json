    "description": "Typography is Code\n\nDescription:\n---------------\nText is everywhere. We read more than ever, probably consuming more written content from glass than from paper. Designing a quality reading experience for dynamic text requires a mindset and workflow different from traditional print typography.\n\nAll digital text is processed by algorithms, so every aspect of how words and sentences are displayed can be shaped with code. This makes programming an essential and powerful skill for designers and typographers. It\u2019s time to explore and embrace methods that will make digital reading interfaces better than printed paper.\n\nIn his talk, Frank will show details from his work and speculate about the typographic workflows of the future.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2016/speakers/frank-rausch\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
