    "description": "You have just set foot at your first design job. There, you begin realizing that designing on the job requires a lot more skills than just in typography and HTML/CSS. How do you effectively communicate your work to non-design colleagues? What steps must you take to grow internally? Most of all, how do you even get noticed in your company? After three and a half years of working at TED as my first job out of college, Iâ€™m here to share with you hard-learned career lessons that we all wish someone would have told us earlier. This talk will hopefully prevent you from flailing around aimlessly for too long like I once did as a young designer.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/lil-chen\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
