    "description": "Time and creativity are inextricably intertwined. The more time you make available to ‘prime the brain’, the greater the range of potential creative outcomes you’ll be sure to enjoy. In short, time and creativity go hand-in-hand.\n\nIn this talk, Christopher Murphy explores strategies for maximising the time you have available to improve your creativity, by: embracing planned procrastination; shaving yaks; and allowing yourself the luxury of working on ‘distractions’, when you should really be focused on the task at hand.\n\nChristopher will explore strategies that can double or even triple your time, if you just let your hair down and let go a little. True to his – procrastinating – word, he’ll be working on the talk right up until the moment he goes on stage.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/christopher-murphy\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
