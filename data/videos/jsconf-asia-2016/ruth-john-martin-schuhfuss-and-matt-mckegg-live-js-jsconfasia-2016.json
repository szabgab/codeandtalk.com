We\u2018re going to bring you JavaScript powered music, visuals *and* interactive lights! It\u2018s been a incredible day of talks, so grab a drink, relax and let Ruth, Martin and Matt entertain you: JavaScript style!\n\nRuth is a web technologist and Google Developer Expert. She likes to educate people about new web technologies and inspire them to try them, coming up with exciting and engaging ways to use them. Her favourite things include interactive audio/visual installations and 80s cartoons, usually at the same time!\n\nMartin works as a creative developer at ubilabs in Hamburg, focusing on WebGL, Data-Visualization and interactive website experiences. In his spare time he plays around at the intersection of electronics and JavaScript and loves to connect random things from the physical world into the web.\n\nBack for his second time at JSConf.Asia, Matt is a JavaScript hacker and backyard musician from Wellington, New Zealand. He is a lover of all things open and modular and spends most of his time pressing buttons of various shapes, sizes and colours. Sometimes these buttons make sounds.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
