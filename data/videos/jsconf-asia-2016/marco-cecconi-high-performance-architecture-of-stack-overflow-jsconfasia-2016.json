    "description": "Stack Overflow is a website that helps millions of developers every day. On the other hand, not many developers realize that this site serves them with incredible efficiency. For example, a question and answer page is typically served in 10ms.\nHow do you serve so many requests in so little time while running on 9 web servers? In this new talk, I will explain how this is planned, implemented and measured.\n\nMarco is a developer in the core​ Q&A​ team of Stack Overflow since 2013. While not creating bugs and fixing them in a hurry, he enjoys blogging on sklivvz.com, covering computers topics from transistors to tech leadership.He frequently speaks on architecture, engineering and Stack Overflow.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\nSlides: http://slides.com/sklivvz/high-perf-architecture-10/?token=W4iDQ79L#/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
