    "description": "Nowadays, live streaming is an essential feature of an internet product. There are tons of examples that show when live streaming can enrich a product: Super-stars connecting with fans, professors broadcasting vivid live courses and live video shopping experiences. \nIn this talk, Iâ€˜m going to use React, a component based framework which makes it easy to build and maintain the bricks and blocks for a live streaming web-app. He'll dive into performance optimizations and how you can migrate your product to offer similar functionality and keep up with this trend.\n\nLee is part of the AlloyTeam at Tencent, China.
