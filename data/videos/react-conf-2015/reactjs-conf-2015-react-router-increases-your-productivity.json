    "description": "Michael Jackson\n\nreact-router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with what's being displayed on the page. The project benefits from several years of combined experience working with the legendary Ember.js router.\n\nThis talk will show how the router makes it easy to implement many common flows including authentication, navigation prompts, and animation. We'll also explore some advanced techniques including server-side rendering and partial application loading.",
