    "description": "We can all appreciate that React apps are easy and awesome. They make great demos that are crushingly good at DOM-manipulations. But as they grow (and they always do), things start to get unwieldy. Big apps \u2014 especially ones with long life-spans, huge data sets, or numerous contributors \u2014 can suffer serious perf and maintenance inefficiencies.\n\nThe Facebook Ads Interfaces team shares what they\u2019ve learned after spending the last year building one of the world\u2019s largest React applications. By being intentional about your app's component hierarchy, separation, and data-passing, you can achieve excellent performance, sustainable even at a massive scale.",
