    "description": "Om is a popular ClojureScript binding to React that streamlines integration with persistent data structures. Besides providing basic global state management facilities, it also contains some unique concepts that will be of interest to both users and implementers of React and React-like systems. This talk will explore the design decisions, tradeoffs, and benefits that result from taking a more aggressive stance on application state when pursuing scalable component architecture.",
