    "description": "Does the application you\u2019ve been working on have customers in any other location but your home town? Do you have to deal with the different time zones of where your customers live?\n\nLearn how to handle different time zones in your apps using a case study of an actual feature request, where we take the existing tools in Rails a step further and run Resque workers at different times defined by defaults or the customer. This talk will cover the problem; how we decided to tackle it; and writing time related specs, so even if you flew to the other side of the world, those specs would still pass.",
