    "description": "With features like foreign data wrappers, Postgres makes it easy for you to integrate rich data stores into your application architectures. Yet sometimes you only have a few rich data structures to deal with, or can’t afford the time and resource cost of running a NoSQL cluster alongside Postgres. Happily Postgres natively supports several document data formats, giving you the best of both worlds in one database. You can keep document oriented data solely within Postgres, or write a foreign table schema that’s naturally compatible with your document database.",
