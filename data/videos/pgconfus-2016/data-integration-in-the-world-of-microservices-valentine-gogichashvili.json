    "description": "Since its launch in 2008, Zalando has grown with tremendous speed. The road from startup to multinational corporation has been full of challenges, especially for Zalando's technology team. Distributed across Berlin, Helsinki, Dublin and Dortmund — and nearly 900 professionals strong — Zalando Technology still plans to expand by adding 1,000 more developers through the end of 2016. \n\nThis rapid growth has showed us that we need to be very flexible about developing processes and organizational structures, so we can scale and experiment. In March 2015, our team adopted Radical Agility: a tech management strategy that emphasizes Autonomy, Purpose, and Mastery, with trust as the glue holding it all together. \n\nTo make autonomy possible, teams can now choose their own technology stacks for the products they own. Microservices, speaking with each other using RESTful APIs, promise to minimize the costs of integration between autonomous teams. Isolated AWS accounts, run on top of our own open-source Platform as a Service (called STUPS.io), give each autonomous team enough hardware to experiment and introduce new features without breaking our entire system.",
