    "description": "Apple's new Swift programming language is open source, fast and great for APIs. It's a great modern language which emphasises consistency, developer productivity and safety. As such, it's a great fit for writing APIs deployed to Linux, including microservices and server-less architectures. \n\nThis session will show you how to build a simple Swift API for deployment to IBM's OpenWhisk server-less environment. In order to do this, I will also cover key features of the Swift language and why it is good for server-side applications. I will discuss the HTTP protocol and how APIs fit within it and we'll look at how to build APIs in Swift before moving on to server-less ones. ",
