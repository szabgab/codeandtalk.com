    "description": "Agile working and cross-functional teams have the ability to silo organisations into teams, programmes and functions. This leads to duplication or work, a reduction in sharing knowledge and worse cuts people off from their support network. At a time when organisations are scaling, structures are flattening and workforces are increasingly fluid, supporting and connecting people is more important than ever. This is where communities of practice come in. \r\n\r\nCommunities of practice have many valuable benefits for both individuals and organisations. In this session, Emily will draw from her experiences of developing communities of practice at the Government Digital Service, government departments and other organisations as well as case studies from her ongoing research into this area. To show you why Communities of practice are a vital piece of your Agile organisation and what role they can play.",
