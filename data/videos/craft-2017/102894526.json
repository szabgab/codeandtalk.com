    "description": "With the growth of the computing field and the integration of vastly different backgrounds into the software engineering industry, there is a emergent lack of maturity around the art of productive discourse. Some of the best ideas and efficiencies are the product of disagreement and debate with peers. \r\n\r\nMarried with anecdotes, I hope to leave you with the tools, techniques, and (most importantly) mindset required to have hard deconstructing conversations about ideas that challenge the validity and merit of different approaches to problems. \r\n\r\nHow can you individually position yourself to yearn for criticism?",
