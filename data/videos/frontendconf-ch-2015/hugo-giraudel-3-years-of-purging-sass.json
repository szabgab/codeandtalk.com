  "description": "Writing Sass is easy. Well, kind of. In fact, the average quality of open-sourced Sass code is quite low. I care. That\u2019s why I have been contributing to dozen of repositories and projects over the last 3 years to level up the Sass game on GitHub.\n\nThis talk is a summary of all the common mistakes, poor practices and bad design patterns I have met along the journey. Hopefully, you will have a deeper understanding of the language after this presentation, able to avoid the usual pitfalls from writing Sass code.",
