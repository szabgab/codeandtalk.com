    "description": "SVG has been around since the late 1990s. In the second half of the noughties it was implemented in browsers natively (before that it was widespread on mobile platforms). In 2001, W3C published a guide to ways SVG could be accessible. This presentation will look at the (sorry) state of the art today, and the path before us if we want to take advantage of SVG to really improve accessibility:\n\n\u2013 What have we learned since 2001?\n\u2013 What SVG can I use at work?\n\u2013 What\u2019s coming up?",
