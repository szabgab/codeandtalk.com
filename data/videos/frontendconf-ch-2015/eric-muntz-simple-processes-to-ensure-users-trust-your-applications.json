    "description": "Users fundamentally need to trust applications. Accurate and performant applications that continually iterate and move forward keep users happy and stimulate growth. I’ll talk through minimal best practices for adding structure to products that will maintain users trust.\n\nI’ll peel back the curtain and show examples we put in place at MailChimp over the last five years while growing from a few hundred thousand to more than 8 million active users, yet staying lean and nimble.\n\nAttendees will take home simple actions to put in place or adapt to their own environments to maintain user’s trust while sustaining growth.",
