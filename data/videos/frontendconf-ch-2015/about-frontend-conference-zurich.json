    "description": "The Frontend Conference in Zurich is a two-day double-track conference: After five successful editions from 2011 to 2015, we are back in 2016, continuing our work to establish the event as Switzerland’s leading conference on state-of-the-art frontend and UX technologies. \n\nThe conference is an excellent platform for Swiss and European researchers, developers and designers to present their projects, latest research and technologies in the fields of Web technologies, Web design and UX/HCI (Human Computer Interaction).\n\nWe’ll offer an opportunity to network with and learn from peers and leading experts in their fields, with contributions both from practitioners and academics alike. Zurich, conveniently located in the heart of Europe, with its universities and flourishing IT sector, is the ideal location for the conference.",
