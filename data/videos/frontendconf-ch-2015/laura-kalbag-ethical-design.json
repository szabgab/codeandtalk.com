    "description": "The web today is filled with products and services that gather and exploit users’ data, ignoring our privacy and personal safety. We need to create sustainable alternatives that can compete against these (mostly) free products. While it might be easier for us to make money from users’ data, we must be more ethical in order to create genuine alternatives.\n\nConsiderate design and user experience will help us make alternatives to the current mainstream tech. We don’t want our alternatives to only be available to a geek elite. Accessibility and diversity will make us design better solutions, and aid new technology in spreading beyond the geeks.",
