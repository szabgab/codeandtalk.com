    "description": "WebGL is normally associated with 3D graphics, which can seem daunting without a background in this field. However, the WebGL API is inherently 2D, merely supplying a very useful toolbox of functionality for creating 3D engines. In this talk, we’ll explore how WebGL can be used to manipulate 2D graphics, by creating a simple image editing application. Through live-coding we’ll see that working with WebGL isn’t all that complicated and a lot can be achieved without having to reach for higher level frameworks. We’ll explore how hardware accelerated image effects like color changes, deformations or blurs can be implemented in a few lines of code.",
