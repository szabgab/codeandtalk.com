  "description": "Over the past few years, several CSS methodologies and JavaScript frameworks have been released. In one year, we receive 32,120 business emails. Every weekday, we're active on Slack for 2 hours 15 minutes. Technology is moving fast, and constantly, there's so much going on. We constantly have to adapt in an ever-changing environment, while somehow still doing our job of building proper, functioning software to the latest tight-super-unrealistic deadline.\n\nThis talk will look at the human side of our daily work in technology. Together, we will examine which factors affect us physically and emotionally in our work. We'll learn how they lead to pressure, stress, self-consciousness and ultimately burnout, and we'll find out how to identify early warning signs of being affected. You'll leave with a realistic look at your own, human capabilities, and the knowledge of what you can do to take care of yourself while working on software. \n\nView Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016\n\n Lena Reinhard likes computers a lot, but she's always been more interested in the humans who work with them.
