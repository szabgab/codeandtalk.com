    "description": "We learned a lot about the offline first concept in the past two years including Service Worker, CouchDB etc.\n\nDid we do everything already to make our applications offline first? Is caching the resources enough? Did we answer all the questions already and if not\u2026 What are the new questions we need to answer?\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll show you what has changed in the last few years, how people did adapt the concept and what are the best practices.\n\nAnd most importantly, can offline first help to save lives? \n\nView Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016\n\nOla is a senior engineer at Styla living in Berlin, who is very passionate about Open Source, the Offline First concept and Hoodie. She loves making the web accessible for everyone, riding the trails, and daughter-driven development.",
