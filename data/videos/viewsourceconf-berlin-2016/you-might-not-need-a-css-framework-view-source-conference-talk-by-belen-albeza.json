    "description": "Nowadays it is very common to find CSS frameworks like Bootstrap used everywhere. But they come at a cost, paid in big CSS files, styles that don't get used, and a hard to maintain code base.\n\nIn this presentation we will talk about why using a third-party framework might not be the right choice for your project, be it a theme or a custom website. We will also see techniques to craft a blog theme without frameworks, from layout to individual UI components. \n\nView Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016\n\nBelén is an engineer and game developer working at Developer Relations in Mozilla.
