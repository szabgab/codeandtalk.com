We'll go over how to enable OpenType features and how you can optimize your font files for the web whether you own them and serve them up through @font-face or through Typekit so you can feel confident serving up gorgeous typography on your sites. \n\nView Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016\n\nHelen is a designer trying to work in the little space where good story, art, and technology all meet.
