I'll be showing the audience OpenType features, explaining why they're important to typefaces, and explaining the tradeoffs they have on performance. We'll go over how to enable OpenType features and how you can optimize your font files for the web whether you own them and serve them up through @font-face or through Typekit so you can feel confident serving up gorgeous typography on your sites. \n\nView Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016\n\nHelen is a designer trying to work in the little space where good story, art, and technology all meet.
