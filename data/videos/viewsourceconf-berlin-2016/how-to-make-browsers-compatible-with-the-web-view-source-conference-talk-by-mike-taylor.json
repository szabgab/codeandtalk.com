    "description": "What does it mean for JavaScript and CSS to be — or not to be — compatible with the web?\n\nIs it possible for a site written today to continue to work in 10 years? Likewise, could existing code complicate adding language features or fixing mistakes in web APIs?\n\nIn this talk I'll discuss the issues that arise when browsers attempt to clean up the web platform, either by adding new language features and DOM APIs or removing old ones — while attempting to remain backwards compatible. I'll even talk about some controversial moves made by browsers to support non-standard (cough webkit prefixes) CSS and JS. \n\nView Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016\n\nMike Taylor is a Web Compatibility Engineer at Mozilla, working from Austin, TX. Previously he worked as a Web Opener at Opera Software, which is a funny title for pretty much the same thing.",
