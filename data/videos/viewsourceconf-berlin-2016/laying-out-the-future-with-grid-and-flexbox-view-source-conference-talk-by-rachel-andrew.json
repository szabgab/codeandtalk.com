  "description": "It is 2016. CSS is now 20 years old, and it has taken this long for us to get a true layout system designed for web pages and applications. A layout system, not based on hacking properties designed for something else entirely, but one that considers the reality of design for the web today.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll introduce this new layout system, a system encompassing Flexbox, CSS Grid Layout and the Box Alignment Module. We\u2019ll take a look at the mindset shift needed to really take advantage of these modules, and also consider what they mean in terms of accessibility and performance. \n\nView Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016\n\n Rachel Andrew lives in Bristol, England.
