    "description": "As the saying goes, all the good ideas in computer science came from the 1970s. We'll explore a new library for parsing text that calls upon an old, unconventional approach: compiling parsers to custom bytecode and then running it through an interpreter.  Along the way, we'll learn about how PEGs fit a sweet spot between regular expressions and heavier parsers, and how Clojure is an ideal language for writing simple compilers.",
