    "description": "Loom is an open-source Clojure library that provides many graph algorithms and visualizations. Loom's graph API focuses on generality and simplicity of integration, which enables other graph representations to be ported to Loom. In this talk, we'll look at how Loom's API and graph implementations evolved in the past 2 years since being presented at Clojure/West 2014. We'll also discuss complexities of maintaining an open-source library.",
