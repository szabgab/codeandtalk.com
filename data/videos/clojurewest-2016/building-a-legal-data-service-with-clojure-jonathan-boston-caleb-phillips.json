    "description": "In the process of litigation, parties must sift through and classify massive piles of data - anything from emails to spreadsheets with millions of rows to entire databases.\n\nIn this experience report, I'll share how Cicayda has used the familiar principles of Clojure - immutability by default, simplicity, and thinking concurrently - to build a robust, multi-tenant cloud hosted SaaS that allows clients to manage diverse data and load profiles. Datomic has given us a ton of leverage, including being able to track how things happened and taking read scaling for granted. ClojureScript has provided us with a unified development environment on both sides of the wire and has helped us push toward a data-oriented UI.",
