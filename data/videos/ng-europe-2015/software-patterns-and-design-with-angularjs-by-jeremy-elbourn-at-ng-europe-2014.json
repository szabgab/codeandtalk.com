    "description": "There's a tendency for engineers to pick up a web development framework and then suddenly forget everything they've ever learned about software engineering. This talk will start by examining how classical OO patterns fit into Angular's different object roles, and how some concepts don't fit neatly into Angular's model. We'll also look more specific techniques that you can use in your app to build some advanced UI features, as well as a few anti-patterns that Angular-using devs may fall prey to.\n\nSlides: http://goo.gl/bJvhoO",
