    "description": "How can we do it? We start with some real world results realized by Jenkins users who have built large clusters and review how they got there. Next, we will do experiments scaling some individual sub-components of Jenkins in isolation and see what challenges we will face when integrated. The famous large, distributed systems undoubtedly faced problems scaling - and we can learn from them, too. The result will be recipes for building Jenkins clusters with different scaling capabilities. After all of this, you can build the biggest Jenkins cluster in the worldâ€¦or maybe just make your own Jenkins cluster more efficient.",
