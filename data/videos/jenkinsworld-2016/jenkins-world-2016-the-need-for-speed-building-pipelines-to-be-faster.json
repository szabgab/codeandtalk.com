    "description": "Response time is paramount for a CI/CD system. In this session, you will see how a few best practices in constructing pipelines can yield faster turnaround times and reduced resource use. We'll also run through plugins and tools to analyze and visualize performance, including the Pipeline Stage View plugin. If time permits, we may briefly discuss some of the computer science theory behind different aspects of performance.\n\nDelivered by Sam Van Oort",
