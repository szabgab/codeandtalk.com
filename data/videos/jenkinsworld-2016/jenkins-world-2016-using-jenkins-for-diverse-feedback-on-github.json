    "description": "Before you have quality code, you need quality feedback. At edX, we provide feedback to developers, both within the company as well as open source contributors. The feedback is given in various contexts, ranging from unit and acceptance tests, to linting and accessibility. Leveraging Jenkins plugins and GitHub integration, developers can run and re-run contexts, and receive feedback on different aspects of their pull requests. This approach brings focus and layers to changes in the system and allows for optimization of tests in specific frameworks that service the developers.\n\nDelivered by Ben Patterson",
