    "description": "Pipeline is as powerful as a loaded gun, but with skill can be as delicate as a surgeon\u2019s knife. This talk will give an overview of health and safety so that you can avoid shooting yourself in the head and walk the path to medical school. It will cover not only what not to do, but also why, and share some solutions so you are not left high and dry. Both James and Bobby have bullet wounds from \u201cChampagning\u201d pipeline to automate the test and release of several of the CloudBees products and can occasionally still be seen walking with a limp from shooting for the moon and hitting their feet.",
