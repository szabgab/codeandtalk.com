    "description": "This talk reviews how outages of Jenkins have impacted Shutterfly’s ability to perform releases over the years. We’ll share how advances made after each outage have actually helped enable a transition from once a month releases managed by a central team, to a model that allows development teams to easily create their own build and release pipelines and practice continuous delivery while adhering to established change control practices. We will highlight container management and our dual-level DSL strategy for managing jobs.",
