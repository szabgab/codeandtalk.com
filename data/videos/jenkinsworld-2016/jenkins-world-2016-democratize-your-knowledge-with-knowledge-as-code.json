    "description": "Today nearly all technology is delivered as a service or treated as code. Why stop with technology?  Treating Knowledge as Code provides a foundation for the continuous delivery of value beyond the bits, enriching your employees and customers by democratizing your knowledge. The success of CloudBees to deliver under increasing pressure from a fast-growing and hungry customer base is only possible through self-service and proactive notifications powered by Knowledge as Code. This talk will outline the CloudBees journey in creating knowledge and leveraging Jenkins to democratize that knowledge for the benefit of our subscribers and our own operational efficiency.",
