    "description": "As a release engineer in a company with several development teams, using several Jenkins instances comes in handy. While this approach works fine in our company and gives the developers a lot of freedom, we came across some long-term problems concerning maintenance and standards. Our problems were mostly caused by misconfiguration/non-usage of plugins. With configuration as code in mind, I applied static code analysis with the help of SonarQube to all of our Jenkins job configurations.\n\nDelivered by David Hinske",
