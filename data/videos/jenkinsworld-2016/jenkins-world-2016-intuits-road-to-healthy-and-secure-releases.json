    "description": "With customers constantly demanding new features in the products and services that they use, Intuit Inc.,  — like many others in this domain — is faced with the challenge of developing and releasing features faster. Releasing faster allows Intuit to not only meet the demand head on but to also stay ahead of the game.\n\nAt Intuit, customer benefits and well-being are of the utmost value.  While it is highly desirable to get a feature to our customers as quickly as possible, it is absolutely necessary that there be no compromise in the quality or security of the products and services provided.\n\nThe shift in the industry towards using open source components opens up a world of possibilities toward developing features faster. While this helps speed up development and reduces costs, there are hidden costs that come in the form of risk.\n\nThe security and licensing violations associated with using open source components exposes Intuit and its customers to unwanted risk.  It is important to understand and reduce that risk or, even better, prevent it altogether.\n\nSo, our aim is to release fast….while maintaining the highest quality and security standards.  \n\nAttendees of this session will learn more about Intuit’s journey to healthy and secure releases using Nexus Repository Pro and Nexus Lifecycle across the CI/CD pipeline — which also includes Jenkins, GitHub, SonarQube — and what the future looks like.",
