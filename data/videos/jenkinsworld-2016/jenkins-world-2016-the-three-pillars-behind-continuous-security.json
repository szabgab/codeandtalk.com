    "description": "This presentation discusses common challenges with people, process and technologies when attempting to leverage the continuous integration (CI) of security tools. When the concept of CI for security tools first surfaced, it seemed quite attractive. However, the reality didn’t quite stack up to the dream. During this session, we’ll talk about the obstacles typically encountered and will arm CI practitioners with best practices to resolve them. The solutions presented can be used in any organization, regardless of size or industry.",
