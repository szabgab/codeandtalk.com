However, CD is not a discipline on it’s own (at least, not yet) and the science behind it is rarely covered in schools.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n* Domain Driven Design (DDD) for CD, based on concepts authored by Eric Evans\n* How the CD Pipeline, along with its assets, can be orchestrated with Jenkins\n* Pipeline patterns that improve speed, quality and reliability\n* Pipeline anti-patterns \n* Microservices Test Architecture that is “hand-in-glove” with the Pipeline\n* KPIs to measure ROI from the Pipeline\n* CD for IoT",
