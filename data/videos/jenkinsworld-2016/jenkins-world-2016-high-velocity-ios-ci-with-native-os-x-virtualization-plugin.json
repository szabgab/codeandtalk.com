Then, using Jenkins and the Veertu OS X native virtualization plugin:\n\n* Provision iOS build capsules in your cloud, on demand, in just a few minutes.\n\n* Manage capsules for different Xcode build libraries and versions, just like you do with code, ensuring that each build can be reproduced at any time and by any team member.\n\n* Dynamically provision as many iOS simulator test capsules for automated functional and regression testing.\n\n* Port iOS build capsules from a developer workstation to a shared iOS build cloud\n\nDelivered by Manisha Arora",
