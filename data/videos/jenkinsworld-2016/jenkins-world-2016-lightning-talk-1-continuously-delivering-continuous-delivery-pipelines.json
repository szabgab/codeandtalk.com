    "description": "Our 600-person IT organization has committed to implementing continuous delivery practices enterprise-wide. This isn't a single momentous event put in place overnight. Rather, it's a strategic journey towards a common goal, and through which each application will take its own unique path. A seminal component of our CD journey is the Pipeline plugin and it has become our standard for CD pipeline orchestration. We will discuss a few of the diverse paths taken by the application teams at our company and show how the use of the Pipeline plugin has uniquely enabled continuous delivery for us in a way that no competing tool can.\n\nDelivered by Neil Hunt",
