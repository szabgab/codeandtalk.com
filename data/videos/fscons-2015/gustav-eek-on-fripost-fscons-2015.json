    "description": "In this talk I will present the Fripost association. Where does the ideas come from?  What have we created in those five years? And what future challenges are we seeking?\n\nIt is custom that Internet services comes with services that the users never asked for: semantic analysis of private conversations, advertisement, espionage, and filtered limited content to name a few. As users of Internet services we have become aware of some of those privacy intrusive aspects, but we also suppose that there is more under the surface not yet reviled. That makes us uneven.\n\nTo address this unevenness, at FSCONS in 2010, we launched the idea of Fripost, a democratic email association. We can now celebrate five years of sustainable existence. Fripost does not only provide non privacy intrusive services for electronic communication to its members. Fripost's services are made free in a broad sense through common ownership and democratic structures. We create technology, but it is not all about technology. Fripost find popular adult education, societal influence, and technology to be of equal importance.\n\nIn the talk, a categorization of threats against privacy, integrity and freedom will be laid out together with a presentation of how Fripost addresses those. Also a road map for Fripost technical, educational, and influence engagements will be presented.\n\nDownload video: https://fscons.org/videos",
