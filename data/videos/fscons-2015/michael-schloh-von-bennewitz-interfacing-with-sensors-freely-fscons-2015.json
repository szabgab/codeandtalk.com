    "description": "In this quarter hour, we'll take a mixed theory and hands on approach at learning the ropes of Internet of Things telemetry and sensor networking. Instead of marching into IoT emerging technology blindly, we'll have a round understanding of technology and consider security measures.\n\nSince we are both consumers and producers of technology, it's useful to understand trends and technical platforms of this fast paced industry. To this end we'll examine use cases, consider human needs, and carry out simple implementations using laboratory hardware.\n\nThe topics of this lecture are relevant to the later workshops of the day titled 'Building an IoT Empire.'\n\nDownload video: https://fscons.org/videos",
