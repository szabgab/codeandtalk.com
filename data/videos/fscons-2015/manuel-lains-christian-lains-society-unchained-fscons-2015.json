    "description": "The opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies and decentralized consensus-networks are practically limitless. We see projects pioneering a vast number of use-cases, including decentralized alternatives to social media platforms, cloud storage, cloud computing, music streaming, gaming, voting platforms and more. In the future we envision strong communities emerging around these and new platforms.\n\nNew crypto-finance tools coupled with decision-making tools enable fair and transparent administration of large entities such as organizations, foundations and enterprises. Leveraging active communities with incentives like equity crowdfunding, we are looking at powerful and efficient ground-up activities on a scale previously impossible.\n\nFurthermore, technologies that allow secure and private identity and sensitive information management, lay the groundwork for competing alternatives to traditional institutions of society. Various political philosophies and organizational models, such as Basic Income rights, could be tested and tried against each other. The potential is here for a true voluntary world with a free market of ideologies and political solutions (Freedom of Association).\n\nDownload video: https://fscons.org/videos",
