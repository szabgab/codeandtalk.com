  "description": "The Java EE Security API has become old and dusty. With applications relying on portable security solutions for cloud environments, Java EE Security has to move away from proprietary server configuration. This session introduces JSR 375, which promotes self-contained application portability across Java EE servers, and promotes the use of modern programming concepts such as Expression Language, and CDI. JSR 375 will holistically attempt to simplify, standardize, and modernize the Security API across the platform in areas identified by the community.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAlex Kosowski\nAlex Kosowski is the Security API JSR 375 Spec Lead. Alex has been principal engineer for the Oracle WebLogic Server Security team for the past 7 years. A Java developer since 2001, his experience includes mission critical financial applications, for which he has lead the development of a Java Batch framework, and a patented HTTP Client Bot framework. Alex is a veteran JavaOne speaker, and enjoys sailing and swimming.",
