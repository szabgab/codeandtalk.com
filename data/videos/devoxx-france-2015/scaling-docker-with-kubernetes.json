    "description": "Kubernetes is an open source project to manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system, managing and running Docker containers across multiple Docker hosts, offering co-location of containers, service discovery and replication control. It was started by Google and now it is supported by Microsoft, RedHat, IBM and Docker Inc amongst others.Once you are using Docker containers the next question is how to scale and start containers across multiple Docker hosts, balancing the containers across them. Kubernetes also adds a higher level API to define how containers are logically grouped, allowing to define pools of containers, load balancing and affinity.\n\n\nAuthor:\nCarlos Sanchez\nApache member and open source contributor in multiple projects, speaking and working on development tools, cloud, DevOps, Continuous Delivery and automation",
