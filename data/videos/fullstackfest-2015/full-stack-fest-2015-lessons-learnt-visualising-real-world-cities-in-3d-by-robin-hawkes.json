    "description": "ViziCities is an open-source 3D city visualisation platform powered by JavaScript, WebGL and many other cutting-edge Web technologies. Think SimCity meets the real world!\n\nIn this talk, Robin Hawkes, ViziCities’ creator will highlight the development issues experienced along the way and show you how he overcame them – ranging from how you tackle the realtime processing of thousands of 3D buildings without locking up the browser, to how you visualise the entire world without needing a server or your own geographic data source.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/lessons-learnt-visualising-real-world-cities-in-3d\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
