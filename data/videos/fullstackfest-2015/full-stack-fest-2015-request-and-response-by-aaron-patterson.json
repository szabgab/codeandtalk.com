    "description": "What goes in to a request and response in a Rails application? Where does the application get its data, and how does that data get to the client when you are done? In this talk we’ll look at the request and response lifecycle in Rails. We’ll start with how a request and response are serviced today, then move on to more exciting topics like adding HTTP2 support and what that means for developing Rails applications.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/request-and-response\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
