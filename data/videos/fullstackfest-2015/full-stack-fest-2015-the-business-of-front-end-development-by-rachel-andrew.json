    "description": "A talk from Full Stack Fest 2015 (http://fullstackfest.com/)\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll take a look at how front-end development has changed over the last few years. How we have moved from being experts in browser quirks to focus on tooling and process. I\u2019ll discuss when and how we should consider using third-party plugins and frameworks, and where we should spend the time really nailing the front-end. We\u2019ll also take a look at where things haven\u2019t changed, and how by taking a progressively enhanced approach to development you can do the best thing for your business and your users.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/the-business-of-front-end-development\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
