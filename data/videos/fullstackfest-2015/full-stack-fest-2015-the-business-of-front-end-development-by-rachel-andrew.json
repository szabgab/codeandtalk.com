    "description": "In this talk I’ll take a look at how front-end development has changed over the last few years. How we have moved from being experts in browser quirks to focus on tooling and process. I’ll discuss when and how we should consider using third-party plugins and frameworks, and where we should spend the time really nailing the front-end. We’ll also take a look at where things haven’t changed, and how by taking a progressively enhanced approach to development you can do the best thing for your business and your users.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/the-business-of-front-end-development\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
