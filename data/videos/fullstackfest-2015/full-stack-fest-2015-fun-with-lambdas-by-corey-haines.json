    "description": "You’ve probably heard about the lambda calculus, building up our computing structures from just the treasured lambda. But how much have you played with it? In this talk, armed only with Vim and the CLI, we’ll explore some interesting topics in building up our world with just the lambda and the thought process while doing it. While you probably don’t want to program day-to-day at this level, it definitely can help with how you think about your regular programming. This talk consists almost entirely of live coding. FUN TIMES!\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/fun-with-lambdas\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
