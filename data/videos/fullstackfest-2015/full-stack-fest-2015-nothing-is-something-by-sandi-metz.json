    "description": "A talk from Full Stack Fest 2015 (http://fullstackfest.com/)\n\nOur code is full of hidden assumptions, things that seem like nothing, secrets that we did not name and thus cannot see. These secrets represent missing concepts and this talk shows you how to expose these concepts with code that is easy to understand, change and extend. Being explicit about ideas will make your code simpler, your apps clearer and your life better. Even very small ideas matter. Everything, even nothing, is something.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/nothing-is-something\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
