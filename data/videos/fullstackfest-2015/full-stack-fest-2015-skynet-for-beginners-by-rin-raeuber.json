    "description": "According to common knowledge Skynet went online on August 4, 1997. Suprisingly, we haven\u2019t heard anything from it since. Maybe because it\u2019s still struggling with the color of that dress. Or maybe because it was written in Excel VBA.\n\nEither way, how about we apply some of those fancy sounding artificial intelligence techniques to the game problem of writing a twitter bot?\n\nThis talk will introduce you to artificial neural networks in an accessible and fun way.\n\nDisclaimer: Might contain traces of code. Self-Awareness not included.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/skynet-for-beginners-using-a-neural-network-to-train-a-ruby-twitter-bot\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
