  "description": "A talk from Full Stack Fest 2015 (http://fullstackfest.com/)\n\nLet\u2019s have a discussion about running ruby apps. After you\u2019ve written your app, how does it run in production. How do you know it is running properly? Are there other ways to run your apps? Getting your apps running and giving you meaningful metrics is just as important as writing them.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/running-ruby-apps\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
