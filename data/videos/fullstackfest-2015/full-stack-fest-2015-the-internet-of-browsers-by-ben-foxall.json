    "description": "Browsers do more than just presenting content; they allow us to gather information about our surroundings and make changes to our environment.\n\nTaking inspiration from the Internet of Things, we’ll think about our browsers as simple objects that can work together to create a closer interaction with the web.\n\nWe’ll have some demos too.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/the-internet-of-browsers\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
