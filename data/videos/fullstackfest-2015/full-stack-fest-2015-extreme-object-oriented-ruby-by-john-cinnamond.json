  "description": "A talk from Full Stack Fest 2015 (http://fullstackfest.com/)\n\nI recently saw the talk \u2018Nothing is Something\u2019 by Sandi Metz and something caught my eye - the idea that Ruby doesn\u2019t need the \u2018if\u2019 keyword. This got me thinking: what else could we remove from the language without making it less powerful? In this talk I take this idea and push it to breaking point. Along the way we\u2019ll learn a lot about expressiveness, the limits of computation, the nature of programming and why we shouldn\u2019t try to create pure OO languages.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/extreme-object-oriented-ruby\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
