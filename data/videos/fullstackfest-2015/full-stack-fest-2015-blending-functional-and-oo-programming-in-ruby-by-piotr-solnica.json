    "description": "Functional programming is being revitalized thanks to languages like Clojure, Haskell and Elixir. Even though Ruby is an object-oriented language there are many beautiful concepts in functional programming that we can borrow and successfully apply in our Ruby code.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll show you how I mix FP with OO. I\u2019ll introduce you to functional objects, explain the beauty of Proc-like behavior, the power of call method and explain why immutability matters.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/blending-functional-and-oo-programming-in-ruby\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
