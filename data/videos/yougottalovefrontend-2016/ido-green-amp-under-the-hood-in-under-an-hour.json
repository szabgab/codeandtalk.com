  "description": "For many, reading on the mobile web is a slow, clunky and frustrating experience - but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere.\nIn this talk, we will cover what is AMP, where you should leverage it and how you should implement it. We will try to do all these and put a smile on your face.",
