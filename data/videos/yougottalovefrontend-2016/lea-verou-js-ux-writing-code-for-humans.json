    "description": "We tend to think of user interfaces and UX as designer concerns that do not apply to us. However, every time we write code to be used by others — or ourselves in the future! — we are creating a UI. A UI whose usability can be vastly improved by many UX principles, some tailored to code, others applying to every UI, ever. \n\nIn this light-hearted talk you will learn a ton of tips and tricks to improve your API design, distilled from Lea’s experience of creating & managing dozens of successful open source projects with thousands of merged pull requests.",
