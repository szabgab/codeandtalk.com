    "description": "React Native brings the power of React.JS to the mobile world. It allows developers to create rich, powerful and truly native apps using web technologies.\n\nWhile we at Facebook know how important fast development process is to developers, we also recognize that performance is a major factor when it comes to engagement and users\u2019 satisfaction. This is the reason why we put a lot of effort into making every part of React Native as fast and lean as it can be.\n\nWe'll talk about the tools and techniques we use to measure and analyze key performance metrics, such as app startup time, memory usage and UI responsiveness, and cover how recent developments, from improving the boot process to re-writing parts of JavaScripts VM, have made a significant impact across all React Native apps.",
