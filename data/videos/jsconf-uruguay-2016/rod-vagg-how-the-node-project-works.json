  "description": "Since the Node.js Foundation became the new home for the core Node.js project, it has been run with a very different governance and contribution model and a new culture of openness. The core team strives to be welcoming to new contributors and regularly adds to its own ranks. Due to historical barriers and the complexities of a very active core community, many find the idea of contributing daunting. Rod will explain how the project works, including its various working groups, teams, how decisions are made, how to find a place to contribute and how you can improve your chances of successfully making an impact on Node.js core.",
