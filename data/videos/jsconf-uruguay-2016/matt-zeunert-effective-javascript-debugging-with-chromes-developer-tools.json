    "description": "Tracing a bug in a complex application can be a frustrating experience. Luckily the tools available for debugging JavaScript code have improved tremendously over the last few years. During this talk, we\u2019ll investigate different bugs and use Chrome\u2019s Developer Tools to find the code that\u2019s causing the defect. This talk goes beyond the most well-known debugger features and demonstrates how to deal more effectively with asynchronous code, library code and unfamiliar codebases.",
