    "description": "JavaScript first enabled the enrichment of website interaction. It made its first appearance as tiny snippets of code that lived inside HTML attributes.\n\nIt went on to enable -unprecedentedly- a new generation of rich applications like Gmail that improved on Desktop counterparts , eg Outlook.\n\nThe web and mobile web are now decisively JavaScript-driven.\n\nWith Node.JS, JavaScript entered the server. It's now the fastest-growing OSS project and community. With Electron, JavaScript entered the OS. Applications like Atom and Slack are entirely JavaScript-powered. With Progressive Web Apps, React Native and NativeScript, JavaScript's entering mobile. Based on its track record, I certainly wouldn't bet against it.\n\nJavaScript is the language that unifies technologies. This talk will explore how its future might look a lot like its beginnings: short snippets of code. Or how the goal of JavaScript is to write very little JavaScript.",
