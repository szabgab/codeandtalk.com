    "description": "What do you think of when I say MIDI, bad computer music? Websites playing annoying background noise when you land on them? Then let me let you into a little secret, let me introduce and educate you into a new world of MIDI.\n\nMIDI is at it’s simplest a data protocol and doesn’t have to be associated with audio at all. With the incredible amount of compatible hardware available to us, alongside the new Web MIDI API, we can start to have a lot of fun with a new world of hardware-powered web tech.\n\nIn this enticing and interactive presentation we’ll journey through the different MIDI specifications and look at other web APIs. From sound with General MIDI and the Web Audio API, to the MIDI Show Control, timing firework and fountain displays with the Web Animation API and on to the latest MIDI BLE standard, what a better way to demo the Web Bluetooth API.\n\nThe web is getting hardware-ready and this talk is a great beginning to those APIs at our fingertips. Think you know MIDI - think again there’s so much more to it.",
