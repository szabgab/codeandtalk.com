    "description": "I find myself often talking about the future of JavaScript (ES2016) and we don’t take the time to think of where it started and where we are now in retrospective. This last May, JavaScript turned 20 years old. We’re going to go through all the previous versions of EcmaScript making emphasis on the features of the specification that were missing until the very first one and simulating how it had been to work with JavaScript on 1996. Last, we’re going to talk about how 2015 has been an inflection point for the future specifications and how they are planned for future years.",
