  "description": "Alright, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.\n\nWe will be looking at cellular automata. A cellular automata is a set of units governed with very simple rules. These units make up a complex system, or a model.\n\nWe can train cellular automata to genetically evolve, making themselves better overtime. We can make them adhere to a set of rules that would make the system reach a certain outcome at the end of N generations. We can even use these concepts in the wild.\n\nWe will be doing it all with JavaScript.",
