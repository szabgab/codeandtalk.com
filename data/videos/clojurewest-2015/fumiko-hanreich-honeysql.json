    "description": "At World Singles, HoneySQL is used to construct over a hundred queries with a dozen filters on the fly for graphing purposes. HoneySQL allows you to represent SQL queries as Clojure data structures, which make it easier to read and debug, simpler to modify, and faster to add more queries. In this talk, we'll build example queries step-by-step with HoneySQL, walk you through from our graph menu setup to how a request is processed on the backend at runtime. We will also cover how filters and joins are handled as well as how the data is customized to be graphed (with highcharts on the front-end). \nBy the end of this talk, you will feel confident about writing elegant, modestly complex queries in Clojure.",
