    "description": "There are many resources to help you build Clojure applications. Most however use trivial examples that rarely span more than one project. What if you need to build a big clojure application comprising many projects? Over the three years that we've been using Clojure at WalmartLabs, we've had to figure this stuff out. In this session, I'll discuss some of the challenges we've faced scaling our team and code base as well as our experience using Clojure in the enterprise.",
