  "description": "Although sound is not uncommon within the Clojure community, this talk will present a more embodied approach to creating and interacting with it through wearables. The talk will consist of a live demo and a quick dive into the code that powers it.\n\nThe demo will contain live sound and video generated from a set of wearable sensors.\n\nCode examples will focus on:\n\nClojureScript on Node.js communicating with the set of wearables and dealing with the flood of live data that they provide.\n\nClojure on the JVM transforms this stream into a multitude of possible events. These events are passed to Overtone and through it generate a highly responsive soundscape. At the same time, these events are also used to construct projected visuals.\n\nThis could not be achieved without Clojure's ability to inter-operate with its host platforms, provide tools for live prototyping, and the incredible diversity of interests within the Clojure community.\n\nWork presented here stems from the Quipucamayoc project. It will culminate in 2016 with an interwoven performance between two communities on both sides of the Andes.",
