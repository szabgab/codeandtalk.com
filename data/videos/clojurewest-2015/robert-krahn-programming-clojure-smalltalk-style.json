    "description": "This talk will introduce the cloxp Clojure development kit. Cloxp aims to combine ideas first found in some of the original Smalltalk and Lisp environments with the possibilities of a modern web-based infrastructure. The tool is build around the fact that Clojure provides rich runtime and meta-programming facilities that enable a highly interactive workflow. Instead of being focused on a file-centric development approach, code exploration, modification, and versioning happens on the level of code entities.",
