    "description": "Sulu is a content management platform built on the Symfony full-stack framework. Sulu’s strengths are its focus on usability and design - both for frontend designers and developers - as well as its out-of-the-box support for many features that enterprise websites need. Being built on Symfony, you get every bit of flexibility that you need. In this workshop, we will create a basic Sulu installation and introduce you to Sulu’s most important features. As an attendee, you should bring some code from one of your current projects. Ideally, you can run that code on your notebook but this is not a hard requirement. Most importantly, you need some real world code to look at.",
