No framework 2. Use a framework. 3. Write own framework. 4. No framework. Once the cycle is complete, the developer is said to be ready. In this workshop, we'll go for stage 3, but replace it with stage 4. In other words, we'll explain how to build our own framework, but from third party components, thus being immune to breaking changes, vendor lock, and other negative side effects of using popular frameworks.",
