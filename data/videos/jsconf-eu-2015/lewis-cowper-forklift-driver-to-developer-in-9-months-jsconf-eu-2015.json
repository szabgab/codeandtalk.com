    "description": "Moving up the ladder from forklift driver and general labourer, to front end developer, with a stint in manual testing, was a big challenge. However it\u2019s exactly what I did, and I couldn\u2019t have done it without following a few core principles.\n\nGetting up the nerve to go to local usergroups, and conferences, and discovering a new found love of public speaking, was a huge leap from labouring. Similarly, I discovered contributing to open source wasn\u2019t that big a deal, and some things certain projects did made it really easy! Also, learning about things like source control was super integral to being where I am today.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
