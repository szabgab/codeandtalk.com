Everybody is using it in their own special way and most people still fill that they are failing to tame the language.\n\nIn this talk I will try to show you what language is trying to tell us for all these years, where is real path to enlightenment or at least we could have fun and look at things we know (or pretending to ;) from unorthodox point of view. ;)\n\nPrepare to meet JavaScriptâ€¦ again.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
