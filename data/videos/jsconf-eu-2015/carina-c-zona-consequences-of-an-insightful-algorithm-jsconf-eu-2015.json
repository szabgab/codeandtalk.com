  "description": "We have ethical responsibilities when coding. We\u2019re able to extract remarkably precise intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn\u2019t consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there? A major retailer\u2019s data-driven marketing accidentally revealed to a teen\u2019s family that she was pregnant. Eek.\n\nWhat are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be so intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes? For instance, an activity tracker carelessly revealed users\u2019 sexual activity data to search engines. A social network\u2019s algorithm accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving families who\u2019d recently experienced death of their child and other loved ones.\n\nWe design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. It\u2019s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic empathy.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
