    "description": "There was a time when data connections like WiFi and Bluetooth didn’t exist, yet people still managed to send information over long distances using clever encodings like Morse Code, sound waves and visual impulses.\n\nWhat can we learn from that?\n\nThis talk looks at ways to use web platform capabilities, like the Web Audio API, Ambient Light Events and Touch Events, to revisit old data transmission techniques and apply them in new contexts. We’ll use demos to explore ultrasonic networking between air-gapped devices, indoor positioning without GPS and sending data through touch.\n\nFinally, we’ll look at the privacy implications these unconventional networking capabilities bring.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
