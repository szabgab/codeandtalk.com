    "description": "What is common for Walt Disney World, airports and magicians? All of these are distorting user\u2019s perception to build illusions that make us feel good even though we don\u2019t notice them so easily. Those are time illusions. Developers, as magicians, can use the same techniques to distort users\u2019 perception of time to deliver fast and competitive products. The talk is about psychology, perception, time and, of course, illusions.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
