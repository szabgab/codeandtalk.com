    "description": "It is long known that the quality and setting of the light in our environment influences our moods and minds in a near-infinite number of ways. Yet the lights in most homes and work places are still restricted to the ever present on-/and off-switches (and maybe some dimming).\n\nEnough of that. Take some of the modern lighting-solutions today, add a healthy dose of JavaScript and sprinkle with some other web technologies to create and control your own lights to suit any of your moods and ideas \u2013 directly from within your browser. In a very colorful talk full of practical examples I will demonstrate a number of those possibilities.\n\nCan we use these tricks to even control professional light-equipment on stage? You\u2019ll see.\n\nGithub repo: https://github.com/beyondscreen/fivetwelve-css\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
