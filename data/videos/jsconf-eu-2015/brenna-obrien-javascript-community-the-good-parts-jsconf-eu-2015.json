    "description": "As front-end dev educator, my heart broke every time a student proclaimed “I hate JavaScript.”\n\nI’ve found the JavaScript community to be extremely positive and welcoming, but we can do better, especially if our newest colleagues aren’t feeling the love. Let’s talk about barriers to entry for new JS devs, both technical and non-technical, and let’s talk about how we can help alleviate them. Learn how to be supportive and inspiring in your daily work, how to teach and explain JS concepts effectively, and how you, esteemed JS community member, can help end the laments of “I hate JavaScript.”\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
