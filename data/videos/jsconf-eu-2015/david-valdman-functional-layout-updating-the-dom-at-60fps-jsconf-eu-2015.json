    "description": "We present a functional take on front-end data-binding. MVC, MVP, MVVM, just the V – there are many useful architectures for data binding when data changes in discrete chunks. For data that changes continuously in time (animations, gesture controlled UI, responsive layout, etc), these are not the best tools. By treating continuously changing layout data in a functional way, and updating discrete changes to a model’s data in an MV* way, we can split the data-binding problem into two cleanly separated problems. In so doing we make all our tools better at what they do best.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
