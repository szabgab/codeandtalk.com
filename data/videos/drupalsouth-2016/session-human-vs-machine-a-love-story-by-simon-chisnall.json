We love automated tests as they allow us to spend more time doing what we do best: writing code, while letting machines do what they do best: automation. We currently utilize automated acceptance, integration and unit tests, visual regression tests, accessibility tests, live monitoring and load tests. In this session, we’ll cover why you should be writing tests and demonstrate our current Drupal 8 CI/CD workflow which uses Codeship, Behat, Pantheon and Browserstack.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/human-vs-machine-love-story",
