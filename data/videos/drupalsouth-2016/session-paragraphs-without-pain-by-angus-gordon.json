One example is the Paragraphs module, which helps us build self-contained, reusable \"chunks\" that content authors can use to create rich, ad hoc structures for landing pages, long-form articles, or any type of content that doesn't fit the straitjacket of a traditional content model.\n\nBut while the Paragraphs approach is great in theory, it's not always implemented well in practice. It's too easy for site builders to throw out all the lessons we've learnt from creating clear, well-defined, well-structured content types, and end up with a sea of Paragraph types that are poorly defined and labelled, confusing for authors, and a nightmare to manage. The fact that Paragraphs can be recursive multiplies this potential for complexity (Paragraphs within Paragraphs within Paragraphs, anyone?).\n\nIn this talk, I'll suggest some best practices for a Paragraphs implementation that's well-planned, sustainable, and most importantly usable by the content authors it's meant to help.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/paragraphs-without-pain",
