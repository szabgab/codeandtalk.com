For the last few years that even included sales. As a manager I had truly risen to the level of my incompetence.\n\nThen I met Drupal. Step Three profit.\n\nI’ll share my top 3 secrets for selling Drupal. This is not a sales seminar, but a few key points that reflect my personal experience and offer some insight into not just what has worked, but why I think it did so. With specific reference to Drupal as a fundamental part of how we sell.\n\nYMMV but I expect to leave time for questions and discussion, or I would welcome a panel on this topic.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/my-top-3-secrets-selling-drupal",
