It has recently been released as an open-source project. Lightning is a Drupal 8 distribution designed to provide a starting point for Drupal 8 projects.\n\nThese projects form the starting point for most Acquia Professional Services projects. During this session we will cover:\n\n- the problem are these projects solving;\n- the benefits and drawbacks of using them;\n- how to start a project using BLT;\n- how to integrate a CI solution with your BLT project.\n\nThe concepts covered should be relevant to anyone kicking off a project in Drupal. Some of the code concepts will require a degree of development experience.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/blt-and-lightning-project-template-enterprise-drupal",
