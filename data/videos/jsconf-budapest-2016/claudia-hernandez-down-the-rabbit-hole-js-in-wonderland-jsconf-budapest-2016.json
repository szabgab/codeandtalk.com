    "description": "What even makes sense in Javascript?\n\nFor a language originally created in 10 days it surely has a lot of quirks and perks many JS developers are unaware of. Sometimes, it might even seem like we fell down the rabbit hole only to find that NaN is actually a Number, undefined can be defined, +!![] equals 1, Array.sort()may not work as you suspected and so much other nonsense that can trip any JS developer\u2019s mind.\n\nThis talk is a collection of Javascript\u2019s oddities and unexpected behaviors that hopefully will prevent some future headaches and help understand the language that we all love in a more deeper and meaningful way.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/claudia-hernandez.html",
