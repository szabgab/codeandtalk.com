    "description": "As a guitar player, I usually use some effect-pedals to change the sound of my guitar. I started wondering: \u201cWhat if, it would be possible to recreate these pedals using the web-audio-api?\u201d. Well, it turns out, it is entirely possible to do so.\n\nThis talk takes you through the basics of the web-audio-api and explains some of the audio-nodes I\u2019ve used to change the live sound of my guitar.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/sam-bellen.html",
