  "description": "Clojure 1.9 will ship with a new standard library: clojure.spec. It provides an extensible syntax for specifying the shape and domain of data. It allows instrumenting functions and macros, so user errors are spotted earlier, and result in better error messages. The real kicker is that specs can form the basis for generative testing.",
