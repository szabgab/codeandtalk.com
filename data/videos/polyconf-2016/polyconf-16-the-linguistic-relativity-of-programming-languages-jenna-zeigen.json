    "description": "The hypothesis of linguistic relativity says that the languages we speak influence the way we think. I argue this applies to programming languages too. However, key differences between spoken languages and programming languages enable us to adapt and shift our ways of thinking more fluidly as we learn programming languages than as we learn spoken languages. We can and should leverage these differences to grow individually as programmers and further advance our favorite programming languages.",
