  "description": "With libraries like Mirage, `js_of_ocaml`, & ARM compiler output OCaml apps can operate at such a low level we don't even need operating systems on the backend anymore (removing 15 *million* lines of memory-unsafe code) - while at the same time, writing UI's is easier & more reliable than ever before, with lightweight type-checked code sharing between server, browser clients, & native mobile apps. We'll look at what's enabled by new tech like Unikernels, efficient JS/ARM output, & easy host interop.",
