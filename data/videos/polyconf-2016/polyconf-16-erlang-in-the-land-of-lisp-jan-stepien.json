    "description": "This talk is dedicated to lessons we’ve learned while designing, developing, and deploying to production our very first Erlang project. Erlang and, even more importantly, its underlying virtual machine have challenged our methods of building systems in our primary language at stylefruits, Clojure. I’ll use our new Erlang-based project as a source of concrete examples and differences. Join me and discover how the rock-solid Erlang platform can affect the way you structure your systems.",
