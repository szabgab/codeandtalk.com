  "description": "Elm is a functional, statically typed language where all values are immutable.This provides a much more robust system that's also much easier to work with than the JavaScript equivalent. Elm encourages separation of code into modules and protects you from runtime errors with a smart compiler that's able to catch most errors before they happen. In this talk I'll introduce the Elm and demonstrate why I think Elm is something all JS developers should be paying attention to.",
