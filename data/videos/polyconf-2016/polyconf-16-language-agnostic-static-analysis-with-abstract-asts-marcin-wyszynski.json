    "description": "codebeat.co is a hosted static analysis tool for multiple languages. We've come a long way in terms of how we analyse source code - from wrapping open-source libraries to writing our own language-specific analysers to writing language-agnostic analysers. In this talk we will cover the idea behind abstract ASTs and how they allow us to quickly add support for new languages.",
