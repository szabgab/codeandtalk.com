  "description": "After I switched from C# (a curly-brace heavy object-oriented language) to F# (a whitespace-sensitive functional language) a few years ago, I started to wonder about the history of programming languages and how they evolve. How does a feature in one language influence a feature in another language -- for instance, where did type providers come from? In this talk, I cover the history of MLs from approximately the dawn of time, eventually focusing on F# specifically.",
