    "description": "A lousy interface on your module irritates users, and could scare off some entirely. It doesn't matter how lovely your class, method, or function is internally \u2014 how users invoke it and get data back from it is what will affect them most, whether you're writing a module for Cpan or internal library routines for colleagues.\n\nSmylers presents a collection of avoidable interface infelicities encountered in the wild, in the hope that we can all agree to never ever repeat them ever again in software we write. Ever.",
