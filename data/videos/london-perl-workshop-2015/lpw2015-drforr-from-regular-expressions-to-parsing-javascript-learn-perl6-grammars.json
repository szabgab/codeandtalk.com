    "description": "We'll start by demystifying Perl 6 regular expressions with some help from Perl5. From there we'll name the blocks that we've captured along the way, and refactor our regular expressions into Perl 6 rules and tokens. Those rules and tokens will combine to form a full Perl 6 grammar, and actions let us generate an abstract syntax tree directly from a bunch of little regular expressions.",
