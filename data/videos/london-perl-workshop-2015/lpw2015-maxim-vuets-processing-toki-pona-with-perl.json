    "description": "toki pona is a constructed language, it strives for making the world simple. Perl is a programming language, it's known to be good at text processing (mangling? cruching?). They both are good, TIMTOWTDI, fun, and intensively rely on context.\n\nIn this talk I want to showcase you the delights of toki pona and use it as an example to demonstrate how Perl can be applied for language processing (mangling? crunching?). We will take a look at parsing free-form text with a help of Marpa and writing a rubbish generator with a help of Markov chains.",
