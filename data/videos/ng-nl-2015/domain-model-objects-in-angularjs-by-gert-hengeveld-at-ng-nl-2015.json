    "description": "Although AngularJS is advertised as an MVC framework, it does not encourage or provide a standardized way to build real model objects. Gert will explain the difference between the Angular $scope object and rich model objects. He'll also demonstrate a way to simplify controllers and services by extracting logic away into JavaScript classes.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cbNH2WHO8WzF1XKPxMJ3gJXmfKnWAl3cN77eJJJdAEw/present",
