    "description": "The world of functional web application development has been transformed by the success of Facebook's ReactJS. The principles of dataflow programming and the benefits of immutable data are now acknowledged by the mainstream.\n\nHoplon and Javelin present a strange, bizarro world â€” an alternate reality in which applications can be developed in a functional dataflow style... without React! We'll talk about the tradeoffs and where Hoplon fits into the cosmic landscape, and hopefully see how Lisp can truly Do It with elegance and panache.",
