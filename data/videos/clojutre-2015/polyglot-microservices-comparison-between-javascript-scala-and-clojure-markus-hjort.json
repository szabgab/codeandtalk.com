  "description": "Rarely you have an opportunity to compare building similar like thingies using multiple different languages. I have been two years working in a team building a microservices architecture for Yle. We have now over dozen of microservices running live implemented in Javascript, Scala and Clojure.\n\nIn this presentation I will share how well have these tools worked for us: what have been their weak and strong points. Since this is a Clojure conference I can already reveal one of our findings: our wish is to slowly move more and more things into Clojure world.\n\nSlides: https://t.co/ZMyTDKyICU",
