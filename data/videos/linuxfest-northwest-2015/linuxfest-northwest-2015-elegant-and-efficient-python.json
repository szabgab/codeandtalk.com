  "description": "Steve Hastings\n\nSlides: http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/sites/default/files/slides/elegant_and_efficient_python.pdf\n\nAs Mark Twain (almost) said, the difference between elegant Python and clumsy Python is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.  This talk will show you how to write beautiful and fast code that takes full advantage of Python's features.\n\nLearn common idioms used by the Python community to write \"Pythonic\" code, and learn why these idioms are popular.  Learn how to use list comprehensions and generator expressions in combination with Python built-ins to do powerful things in a small amount of code.  Learn how to use generator functions to make your main loop simpler and easier to understand.  Learn the difference between \"mutable\" and \"immutable\" data structures, and use the word \"mutate\" non-ironically.\n\nYou will get the most out of this talk if you already know the basics of Python, but you are still welcome if you just want to get a taste of the flavor of the language.  Come and see why Python fans are so fanatical!",
