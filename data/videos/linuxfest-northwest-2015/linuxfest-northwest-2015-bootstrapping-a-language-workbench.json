This is the promise of Domain Specific Languages(DSLs). Unfortunately, the time and cost to build translators and support tools have prevented the construction of these new languages. A Language Workbench reduces the effort to create a DSL tailored for a narrow set of applications.\n\nThis presentation chronicles our efforts to bootstrap a language workbench called Language of Languages and create a minimal viable open source offering.",
