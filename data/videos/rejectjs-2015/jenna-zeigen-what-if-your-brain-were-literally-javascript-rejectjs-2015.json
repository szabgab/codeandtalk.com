This talk will take three facets of human cognition: attention, knowledge representation, and language processing, and compare them to analogues in JavaScript: the event loop, the object and prototype system, and the parser.\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de",
