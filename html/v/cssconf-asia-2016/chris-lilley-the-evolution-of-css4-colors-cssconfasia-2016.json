{"description": "After attending this talk you will understand that color is a measurable, reproducible sensation; standardized since 1931! You will get white point adaptation. You will understand Lab color space, be comfortable with gamut volume plots, and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims about color gamut coverage in advertising. You will be really looking forward to seeing CSS4 Color implemented in all the browsers.\n\nChris Lilley is a Technical Director at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Considered \u201cthe father of SVG\u201d, he also co-authored PNG, was co-editor of CSS2, chaired the group that developed @font-face, and co-developed WOFF. Ex Technical Architecture Group. Chris is still trying to get Color Management on the Web, sigh. Currently working on CSS levels 3/4/5 (no, really), Web Audio, and WOFF2.\n\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 24 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.cssconf.asia/\nSlides: https://www.w3.org/Talks/2016/css4-color-talk/#intro\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
